Training has resulted in a significant transition from low to high job status for returnees.\n4. Increased job status and income has increased the responsibilities and opportunities of returnees in their various occupational roles.\n5. Both men and women have short significant improvements in job status and income, with women, as a group. advancing somewhat more than men in overall income gains at the mid-and lower-income brackets, while white a smaller percentage of men advanced more in the highest income bracket.\n6. Returnees living in urban environments are earning more than those who are living in rural areas: lack of opportunity in rural areas has resulted in the migration of 31 percent of Trainees of rural origins to urban areas.",

      "Key Findings": "Women in El Salvador are significantly\nunderrepresented in key STEM-related degree programs (or majors) critical for innovation and\ngrowth such as technology and engineering (22 percent student female enrollment compared to\n54 percent overall female enrollment in Salvadoran HE Is). Five year trend data for female enrollment in technology and engineering majors shows a worrisome decline from 26%\nto 22% from 2009 to 2013. On the other hand, enrollment data from science programs, such as chemistry and biology shows that females participate at around the same rate as males. \n\nWith regard to faculty, females account for 36% of all professors, however they make up only 27% of\nfaculty teaching STEM-related subjects.\n\nOverwhelmingly, focus group and interviews pointed to a culture of machismo (strong masculine\npride) that continues to influence El Salvadoran women's education and career choices and steers them away at a young age from STEM-related fields. However, focus group discussions point to a changing mindset among young people,\nboth male and female, that believe women need to be more supported in STEM.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Women's participation in STEM education and jobs should be approached as a gender issue and equally important, as a way of promoting scientific and technological excellence. Ultimately, by not engaging women in STEM at a greater rate, El Salvador is losing out on a huge potential of talent and human capital, which is the foundation for the country's future economic growth and competitiveness. Based on the findings of this Gender Analysis, the following recommendations are offered for the Activity to address gender integration overall:\n\n1. Explore low-cost ways to raise awareness among high school girls about STEM degrees\nand careers, thereby increasing the pipeline of girls enrolling in STEM-related undergraduate degree programs.\n2. Leverage women in leadership positions in both HE Is and industry to raise the profile of females in STEM and higher education.\n3. The Activity should encourage industry partners (CASATIC, ASER, ASI and CAMAGRO) to start collecting sex-disaggregated data on their members· employees, preferably broken down by type of position.\n4. The Activity should initiate a dialogue with industry partners to recommend gender integration in job announcements and promotions made by their business members.\n5. Provide technical assistance to the leadership of HE Is about the relevance of cross-cutting gender integration strategies, and the importance of promoting access to females for STEM careers in academia and industry.",

      "Key Findings": "Malawi is among the dozen most vulnerable countries globally in terms of adverse effects of climate change (CC), especially drought, but also floods/heavy rains. Heavy dependence on rain-fed agriculture of both the national and local economies, and for the livelihoods of the majority (85%) rural population makes Malawi particularly vulnerable. Factors including high population density and poverty, small landholding sizes, and the low-input low-output farming systems exacerbate farmers’ vulnerability and reduce the resilience of agricultural systems and adaptive capacity of farming communities to effectively respond to adverse CC impacts or take advantage of emerging opportunities.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Understanding the status and shortfalls in knowledge on climate change (CC) in agriculture provides a baseline for diverse stakeholders to use in enhancing medium- to long-term CC adaptation policies, and planning and \nimplementation of sustainable and climate-proofed (maize-based) food-system innovations that enhance yields, food security and incomes for smallholder  farmers while also positioning agriculture to contribute to CC mitigation. \n\nSuccessful CC adaptation will require\nreconciling divergent perceptions and integrating compatible indigenous and scientific knowledge to ensure that famers, extension agents, managers, policy makers and scientists understand what is changing with weather/climate, how, where, and what they can do about it.\n\nCC adaptation should also prepare farmers to capitalize on emerging opportunities under future CC.\n\nThere is still a need to integrate CC considerations explicitly into current and future major agricultural program, including FISP, and increase resources for meaningful adaptation among smallholder farmers.",

      "Key Findings": "A robust scientific infrastructure is ultimately self-sustaining, with virtually limitless potential to impact health, economic development, environmental protection, food security, and many other areas. Outcomes and impacts from our work include:\n\n1. Generation of new knowledge and resulting social impact on health, environment, and livelihoods;\n2. Leveraged funding and other resources for research and education;\n3. Enhanced science teaching and learning with more opportunities for hands-on training; and\n4. Improved visibility and reputation of partner departments.\n\nData collected during the period of the GDA shows that our Instrumental Access model works as anticipated; a well-designed, end-to-end model for equipping LMIC university departments does in fact lead to more research, better training, leveraged research resources, and progress towards improved development outcomes. Moreover, the speed with which these outcomes have been observed is significant. Within 2 years or less of receiving equipment, measurable progress was observed at all of the partner institutions studied. Such rapid progress underscores how substantial a barrier lack of access to modern lab equipment is for LMIC scientists. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "The Seeding Labs should continue their support of scientists to become leading problem-solvers on the global stage. Additionally, partner with private sector institutions, medical and veterinary diagnostic labs, and government control quality labs. Expanding the application of the Seeding Labs' Instrumental Access model will increase the sustainability of Seeding Labs, provide the labs with greater opportunities to share their insights, and meet the needs of a wider population of scientific and related professionals worldwide.",

      "Key Findings": "Lessons Learned from Past Individual Training Programs\n\n1. An overemphasis on the individual’s training objective.\n2. Institutional strengthening and training conceived as separate with little crossover leverage.\n3. In programs with a clear focus on institutional strengthening, training is viewed as the driver to improve institutional performance.\n4. Institutional needs assessments are often biased towards identifying gaps in human resources, and particularly technical knowledge\n5. Minimal connection to home-country institutions.\n6. Increasing but still limited attempts to build soft skills.\n7. Action planning not generally integrated into training programs. \n8. Mentoring can be better utilized as a tool for institutional capacity development. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "Recommendation on Aligning Program with Articulated Goals\n1. Take an integrated approach leveraging individual training for institutional performance improvement\n2. Start small, scale up to meet the broader goals for Pakistan’s higher education sector.\n3. Give serious consideration to the value of training students in cohorts.\n4. Find ways to further align the scholarship program with HEC’s goals for enhancing IT-embedded\nteaching and learning into the program.\n5. Consider supporting EdD, MFA/MS and MA degrees when those degrees are the terminal degree in the field\n\nKey Considerations for Implementing the Scholarship Program\n• Invest in placement and advising services.\n• Invest significantly more in the preparation of students, beyond GRE and TOEFL.\n• Utilize action planning for HEC scholars.\n• Change eligibility criteria for students.\n• Adjust the timeline for recruitment to an 18-month cycle.\n• Send students on a J-1 visa.\n• Use Carnegie Classification to determine eligible host universities.\n• Invest in support to returning students – think about incentives beyond the five-year obligation.\n• Build in opportunities to conduct research in Pakistan during dissertation period.\n• Set up a competitive fund for dissertation research.\n\nOverview of Program Implementation Options. APLU recommends creating the scholarship program with two possible avenues for students to obtain\nsupport from HEC:\n• Provide “research and assistantship grants” to US universities. This would involve negotiating agreements with a set of US institutions to host cohorts of students, and providing funding directly to the US institutions in the form of student assistantships and research grants.\n• Offer a package of financial support to students who gain admission with an assistantship (covering full tuition with a stipend) on their own to a US university. \n\nDetailed Program Implementation Recommendations for the Research Grant Model\n1. Invest more per student\n2. Invest in the upfront negotiation of grant agreements\n3. Start with a small number of university agreements\n4. Make the process competitive among US universities\n5. Consider front-loading the funding\n6. Minimally constrain use of funds and years of funding. ",

      "Document Title": "Sustainable Higher Education Research Alliances (SHERA): Baseline Study Report",
      "Key Findings": "Overall, most CCRs scored in the low-middle range (score of 2), meaning that they have some knowledge and experience with partnerships, collaborative research and activities included in SHERA’s results framework. However, it would tell a slightly different picture if looking at the following three indicators where SHERA uses as the basis for baseline survey data collection and analysis, 1) partnership capacity; 2) collaborative research capacity; and 3) where do CCRs stand on SHERA’s results framework.\n\nIn partnership capacity, ITB and Universitas Indonesia (UI) have the most experience partnering in collaborative activities with other Indonesia-based HEIs, while Institut Pertanian Bogor (IPB) and UI have the most experience in working with U.S.-based HEIs in a similar capacity. These experiences are valuable, as the Lead CCRs can then mentor their Indonesian affiliate partnership members that have minimal exposure or experience working with other Indonesian HEIs and U.S. based institutions. Universitas Sriwijaya (UNSRI), affiliate member within NCSTT, and Universitas Papua (UNIPA) and Universitas Mataram (UNRAM), affiliate members within Animal Biotechnology and Coral Reef\nFisheries (ANBIOCORE), led by IPB, are three examples of Indonesian universities with minimal to no experience partnering with either Indonesian or U.S.-based institutions, and will greatly benefit from mentorship from the Lead CCRs.\n\nIn partnerships, the affiliate members’ awareness and understanding of the project implementation processes, roles and responsibilities, expectations for managing reporting and communications varied among CCRs. In general, the affiliate reported having minimal understanding of their CCR’s purpose, as well as the reporting and accountability process. Most of the responses provided were clearly their best guesses or ideals related to what a CCR should be, as opposed to clear and realistic statements of what their CCRs are based on their knowledge.\n\nIn collaborative research capacity, IPB and UGM scored the highest among the five Lead CCRs. Specifically, both institutions noted easy access to research methods courses. Compared to other Lead CCRs, both also cited a high-level of confidence in their staff members’ English language ability,\nas well as their institutions’ efforts to include women scholars in research activities.\n\nOn the CCR’s current state within SHERA’s Results Framework, all the Lead CCRs have a middle-low score meaning that the project will need to build the capacity of the CCRs and provide technical assistance to ensure achievement of the intended outcomes by project completion. Several notable challenges that are commonly faced by the CCRs are the institutions’ lack of platforms to track the number of published papers that have been cited; records of how research initiatives results have been replicated, applied or taken to the market; and institutional policies for research and management that are gender inclusive.",
      "Key Recommendations": "The findings from the baseline study resulted in a recommendation from SHERA on the target setting for SHERA’s results framework through project completion. SHERA experienced a delay in producing the recommendations due to the CCR’s own delay in aligning their work plans within the project’s monitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework. SHERA has diligently worked with each CCR on their work plan and targets per performance indicator, which is critical to achieving the intended outcomes. At the end of the process, SHERA believes that the targets proposed by the CCRs were overly ambitious in some areas, and SHERA continues to work with them to identify increasingly realistic targets.",

This is attributed to a number of factors including the following: conducive policy environments, leverage of government systems, availability of teaching and learning materials with a pupil to textbook ratio of 1:1, use of result-oriented research-based information and communications technology (ICT) methods, teacher training and supervision, economic factors/government buy-in and spending, improved infrastructure such as electricity and school feeding, and learner factors.\n\nPupils in schools with and without a functional library show small and inconsistent differences. The differences based on where the school gets its textbooks are inconclusive, as are the differences between schools with electricity, a feeding program, and a\ncomputer room.\n\nFull day school shifts (versus half day) also contributed to better reading (and numeracy) outcomes.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Tusome outlined a sustainability plan where the MoE will assume full responsibility of all activities by January 2020.\nActivities include the following: development, printing, and distribution of instructional materials; data management on Dashboard; teacher trainings and professional development; on-going classroom support; and mentoring and coaching.\n\nSpecific efforts from the Government of Kenya (GoK) under the MoE include continued training, capacity building, and consistent\nsupport of CSOs and the continued training of headteachers on how to provide instructional leadership for their schools while managing the acquisition, proper utilization, and maintenance of\nthe new learning materials.",

      "Key Findings": "• Leaders employ the evidence they perceive as most\nhelpful to diagnose problems, set priorities, and design\nor inform implementation strategies\n• Leaders use national statistics and evaluation data most\nfrequently and also found them to be the most helpful\nsources of development data\n• Leaders overall give the nod to qualitative analysis as\nmost helpful by a slim margin, though government\nofficials appear to place a higher premium on impact\nevaluations\n• Leaders use national level information more frequently\nthan cross-national or subnational information\n• The majority of leaders use information that they\ndiscover from in-person interactions, either via formal\nmeetings or informal communications\n• Leaders generally view domestic sources of data\nand analysis to be quite helpful, but give\ngovernment agencies the highest marks as\ninformation providers\n• The value of non-governmental information is highly\ncontext specific: data and analysis produced by local\ncivil society is most helpful in countries with open\ncivic space\n• Leaders put data and analysis from development\npartners at the top of the class when it comes to the\nhelpfulness of international information sources\n• Not all development partners are equally popular:\nmultilateral organizations command a larger user\nbase for their data and analysis than their bilateral\ncounterparts overall\n• Multilateral organizations with a specific regional or\nsectoral focus are viewed as the most helpful\ninternational information sources\n• Multilateral development partners, the United\nStates, and Germany punch well above their\nfinancial weight in terms of attracting domestic\nuptake of their data and analysis\n• Large bilateral and multilateral donors were\ngenerally rated as more helpful information\nproviders, but focused multilaterals appear to punch\nabove their financial weight",
      "Key Recommendations": "• Context is key: to capture the attention of leaders,\ninformation providers must demonstrate a clear\nunderstanding of local realities in LICs and MICs\n• Be constructive: to motivate leaders to take action,\ninformation providers should not only diagnose\nproblems, but offer practical policy recommendations\n• Know your niche: leaders expect somewhat different\nthings from domestic and international information\nproviders, which is an opportunity for greater\nspecialization\n• Stand out: to break through the noise, leaders want\ndomestic sources of information to offer new and\nspecific insights\n• Be responsive: leaders want international sources of\ninformation to be more aligned with national priorities\n• Co-create with users: involve leaders throughout the\nprocess of collecting, interpreting, and disseminating\ninformation",

      "Key Findings": "Our findings indicate that the concentrated, mentored clinical research training in global health settings provided by the FICRS-F Program exerted a major influence on the professional career trajectories of its alumni. The Program appears to have played an instrumental role in training and retaining researchers for global health careers. Program alumni indicated that the mentorship they received influenced their post-training decisions and career investments. Relationships with non-trainee colleagues at the training site were also influential, especially for U.S. postdoctoral Fellows; relationships with other Fogarty trainees were more influential for U.S. doctoral Scholars than for Fellows.\nU.S. postdoctoral Fellow alumni and all international alumni reported higher current and cumulative career focus\non research and on global health than did U.S. Scholars. The FICRS-F training program also strongly influenced choices of future training and career positions and institutions, specialties or topic areas, and competitiveness for career advancement or training positions.",
      "Key Recommendations": "We believe that training LMIC scientists in situ may encourage talent to stay at home, rather than migrate to high-income countries. Nearly two-thirds of the U.S. alumni had already returned to the LMIC research site after completion of the FICRS-F Program. This has laid a solid foundation for international, interdisciplinary collaboration in future global health research.",

      "Document Title": "Universities as Research Partners ",
      "Key Findings": "Projects involving universities as partners are less likely to develop and commercialize technology sooner than expected. This association perhaps reflects the fact that universities are involved in more difficult projects to begin with, namely projects with a lower probability of early completion.\n2. Large projects and/or projects with large lead participants are less likely to expect to develop and commercialize their technology sooner than expected compared to projects with non-profit or medium-sized lead participants. \n\n3. It is also the case that projects with a small lead participant are less likely to expect to develop and commercialize technology sooner than expected. Recall that this group is very small firms, and this may reflect resource constraints they face in development when the project budget does not cover the full cost of making the technology commercially viable.\n\n4. Lack of experience with a university partner reduces the expectation of early commercialization, as does university involvement, perhaps because of lack of market pressure and focus on the particular project by the university participant, or perhaps simply because some adjustment costs are included as the participants learn to work with a university.\n\n5. Projects in information technology, chemicals, energy, and the environment, and materials are significantly more likely to commercialize earlier than expected than projects manufacturing, electronics, and biotechnology.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "\n Our first conclusion is that universities create research awareness among the research partners in the ATP-funded projects studied. The qualitative models estimated suggest that projects with university involvement, either as a research partner or as a subcontractor, are one, experiencing difficulties acquiring and assimilating basic knowledge for the project’s progress; and two, not anticipating being able to develop and commercialize technology sooner than expected when the project began.\nThese two findings could be interpreted to mean that university involvement is creating research problems in these two dimensions.  We base our interpretation on the fact that ATP-funded projects with university involvement are less likely to terminate early compared to projects without university involvement \n- Research Funding Influences the Scope of the Research: Projects with larger research budgets seem to be undertaking research of a broader scope than that considered by other projects, as opposed to researching a narrow project in greater detail.  It is also true that larger budgeted projects have fewer problems acquiring and assimilating basic knowledge. Thus, if the larger budgeted projects are broader, the scope and breadth would appear to address new applications rather than fundamental basic research.\n-We do not speculate as to the extent to which our findings can be generalized to either other projects that are partially publicly funded, or to private sector joint ventures with and without university research interactions. As more research is conducted on this topic, the wider applicability of the observations we set forth in this concluding section will and should be tested.\n",

The late Willis Harman, founder of the World Business Academy, wrote in 1990 that:\n\"Business has become, in this last half century, the most powerful institution on the planet. The dominant institution in any society needs to take responsibility for the whole—as the church did in the days of the Holy Roman Empire.\"\n\nHarman lamented that business firms were slow to accept the new role.  Thirty years ago Paul G. Hoffman, the first Administrator of the United Nations Development\nProgramme wrote that:\n\n“just as politics is too important to be left entirely to politicians, development may well be too important to be left solely in the hands of ‘developers’. Speaking both as the Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme and as a private citizen who cares greatly about the future of his world, I say that development cannot and should not be the exclusive province of the ‘experts’ no matter how skillful or well intentioned. It is too big, too complex, too crucial an undertaking not to merit the involvement—or at least the concerned interest—of the majority of people in every country on earth.”\n\n\n",

      "Key Findings": "Practical application of knowledge happens within the context of institutional constraints, economic and political environments that shape decision-making. These factors make it a challenge to simply insert and implement research conducted in a controlled setting into the complex and messy world of practice.\nKnowledge translation is a nonlinear, fluid process that has implications for all stages of the research process. Underpinning the success of knowledge translation are partnerships and collaborations to develop a research process that meaningfully involves end users throughout the process, beginning with the development of the research question.\n\nKnowledge translation literature suggests five basic themes that form a knowledge translation focused research programme, including stakeholder engagement, knowledge dissemination and exchange, organisational support and culture, and monitoring and evaluation of research uptake. In addition, special consideration is needed for research that is intended to inform policy.\n It should be noted that there is considerable overlap between each of the themes, and aspects of each theme occur at every stage of the research process. The importance of each theme will vary depending on the research programme.\n\n\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "Researchers need to understand what forms of published information are most useful for engineers in their work, how they search for and access that work, and how aware they are of current peer-reviewed research. Specifically, organisations need to encourage researcher to not just produce excellent research, but to engage with end users and come up with joint solutions to help facilitate use of new technologies. \nSecondly, engaging stakeholders in the research process and incorporating research findings into practice takes time and is difficult when organisations don’t support or recognise these activities. Both research and practitioner organisations need to invest sufficient time and money in engagement with knowledge translation activities.\nUnderstanding how policymakers use research in their decision making and how to present information in a useful way can help researchers more effectively engage in the policy process. For example, research will be of increased relevance to policy makers if it incorporates an analysis of contextual factors such as economics, public perceptions, and local applicability.\nFinally, improving the resilience of communities to natural disasters requires that advances in earthquake engineering research are disseminated and implemented in practice and policy in a timely manner. A knowledge translation framework has been successful in closing the gap between research, practice, and policy in health and other fields, but more research is needed to adapt and implement this framework in the context of earthquake engineering and related fields.\n\n",

      "Key Findings": "-There has been important reform of the NARC structure, with policy development and research coordination now formally separated from research implementation. The number of research projects being undertaken has been rationalized and the program consolidated, a successful proactive search for new funding sources for high priority topics has been undertaken; and there has been an increase in collaborative R&D activities with NGOs and the private sector.\n\n-There has been some improvement in an integrated multi-disciplinary approach to outreach programs at Regional Agricultural Research Stations (RARS).  There has been significant improvement in the systematic discussion and prioritization of research.in the regions, with evidence that some of these new programs are being driven by the farmers’ agenda. \n-The NARC Vision 2021 has been produced and approved, although it still requires final endorsement by the Cabinet. Plans for implementing the Vision, which defines NARC's future role in the wider national research system vis a vis other players are under preparation, but much more time is needed to complete the work.\n\n-Many new initiatives have been started since the MTR, but these are far from being sustainably institutionalized. The review of Farmer Groups undertaken by the ICR mission confirms that anticipated extension service reforms still have some way to go before they can be said to be fully incorporated into regular activities throughout the country.\n\n-There has been some increase in the number of groups formed by DADOs,but the survival rate beyond the first year of establishment has been a problem.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "-The design and preparation of projects like AREP must be based on broad-based stakeholder\nparticipation, especially the project beneficiaries, and must reflect national  priorities, to help establish full\nborrower ownership. \n\n-Where a project calls for extensive institutional reforms the design must realistically reflect the ability, and the commitment of the borrowing country to adopt new systems. \n\n-The need for a Project Coordination Unit should be carefully assessed on a project by project basis to ensure line agencies take full responsibility for project implementation, and on project closure that there is no institutional sustainability. Where issues such as procurement or large training programs are perceived to be administrative problematic without a PCU arrangement, outsourcing to specialized agencies should be investigated.\n\n-Credit funds should be cancelled judiciously in institutional reform projects such as this, and only after it is certain they will not be needed. \n\n- The need for technical assistance, must be critically assessed, and where it is needed, it must be fielded on time, and preferably be grant financed. If Technical Assistance is considered essential, procurement should be sufficiently advanced prior to the Board date, to avoid start-up delays. \n\n-Higher level training should be undertaken as early as possible in the life of a project. This means\nplanning for the first batch of trainees needs to be well advanced before the Board date. It should also be phased in\nsuch a way as to minimize disruption caused by long staff absences and to allow initial trainees to be involved in\n",

      "Key Findings": "Forage technologies enabled farmers to transform a marginal livestock production system into a profitable farm enterprise and provided the entry point for changing and improving cattle production in Ea Kar. Forages provided immediate benefits to farmers and paved the way for farmers, extension workers and local government leaders committing to livestock development. Without such an ‘engine’, the commitment of stakeholders to working together may not have developed. There was reciprocity between participants. Early local government support and participation ensured that project activities contributed to the livestock development ambitions of the district government\nwhile, at the same time, the project helped shape the livestock development strategy of the district.\nFurther, personalities of individuals were important at all levels. For example, excellent inter-personal relationships between key stakeholders developed and were a crucial component of the effective working partnership that developed in the project. This development of trust among actors was central\nto the development effort.\nFinally, there were many stakeholders who contributed to a successful outcome during the process of development of cattle production systems in Ea Kar. The stakeholder matrix grew in both number and complexity as the project moved from forage research to livestock development and scaling out.\nResearchers continued to contribute significantly to the development but were only one among many stakeholders who influenced the final outcome.\t\n\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "Although this case study did not explicitly pursue an innovation systems approach, many of the experiences outlined show how an actor-oriented approach can enhance innovation capacity in a sustainable way. The study also emphasises the key role that appropriate technological interventions play in enabling farmers to\nengage in more market-oriented cattle production in Ea Kar.\n",

      "Key Findings": "-The project made significant progress towards achieving its initial core objectives, particularly with regard technology generation and institutional development. And this has contributed to positive outcomes as measured by the achievement of PDO outcome indicators and the high estimated benefit-cost ratio for the project of 6.2. \n\nAn impressive array of new technologies and practices has been developed by NARO, with many in collaboration with other partners. With the far-reaching reforms enacted through the NARO Act 2005, with its decentralized research institutes and substantially strengthened arrangements for stakeholder participation and oversight to ensure research is more demand driven and relevant to the needs of farmers in their local agro-ecological and economic circumstances, NARO is recognized as one of the leading agricultural R&D institutions in the East African region. \nDuring ARTP II NARO also contributed to the global knowledge pool. Available records indicate NARO scientists generated 116 publications, 52% of which were international refereed journals. A number of studies including the end of project evaluation depicted various levels of outcomes and impacts of investments in research.\n Among the non-starchy staples, mosaic resistant cassava varieties averted famine in northern and eastern Uganda; saving the national economy an estimated US$ 60 million per annum. \n\nAgronomic practices for seed-potato and ware-potato provides the technology backbone of value chain that links 60 farmers to a multi-national food chain (NANDOS). A number of bean varieties were generated to address different agro-ecologies and market preferences. \n\n\n\n\n",

      "Key Findings": "In a reflection of general global funding trends, PDPs focusing on one of the ‘big three’ diseases (HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria) received the largest amounts of funding in 2007. There were notable exceptions, in particular Program for Appropriate Technologies in Health (PATH) which received US$25.6m for vaccines against diarrhoeal diseases, and DNDi, which received US$22.7m for kinetoplastid drugs. 2007, PDPs collectively spent US$261.6 million on R&D activities (as IVI did not submit data on expenditure to the G-FINDER survey, this PDP is not included in the analysis in this section). Expenditure fell into two categories, being invested either into their own laboratories and R&D staff (US$42.8 million or 16.4%) or disbursed to external partners such as academic research institutions, contract research organisations (CROs) and large and small pharmaceutical companies in developed and developing countries (US$218.8 million or 83.6%).\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "The analysis demonstrates that PDPs are playing an increasingly major role as managers of R&D funding for neglected diseases, while the portfolio approach of effective PDPs both protects product development and reduces funding risk. This analysis suggests that funding for effective PDPs should be preferentially protected in difficult times, unlike those happy periods where funding is unconstrained and the appetite for risk is higher.\n\nFinally, urgent measures need to be taken to support effective PDPs in their increasingly important role as creators, developers and deliverers of new products for neglected diseases. In this context, it is worth noting that most public funding for PDPs comes from national aid agencies, whose role it is to support the developing world, yet 87.8% of PDP R&D funds are re-invested directly back into Western, and often national, academic institutions, contractors and pharmaceutical firms.\n",

      "Key Recommendations": "Overall, we want a system that is independent in order to achieve external credibility and social legitimacy, but not so independent that it loses its internal relevance. The placement of the system and the powers to publicly disclose the information produced, without a bias towards positive results, are key determinants of independence, credibility and legitimacy. \nIt is important to enjoy a unique and broad legal mandate to ensure enforcement of recommendations, and avoid competing initiatives that undermine consolidation and legitimacy. Legal support from Access to Public Information or Transparency Laws is also an important asset to back full public disclosure, especially in systems located within the executive.\nIn terms of independence, a best practice example is provided by external governing bodies like the academic board of Mexico’s Coneval.\nIn addition, we want a system that is able to influence policy-making and the adoption of recommendations, either by promoting ownership or by using enforcement powers.\n\nAlso, there needs to be a clear focus on usage and clarity on a client or set of clients that are to be served, and what their interests are. It can be Congress or Parliament, the broader society, central government or program management. \n\nFinally, we want a system that is sustainable over time and transcends governments because it is perceived as responsive to the needs of clients and useful to its main stakeholders. For this, the performance of the systems should begin to be tracked.\n\n\n\n\n",

They are characterized by a high degree of scientific uncertainty and there are intense political differences and conflicts of interest influencing perception of the new challenges and therefore also influencing views on policy options. Whether or not a particular response to climate change is desirable, whether the benefits following globalization of our food chains exceed the potential losses of local livelihoods, and whether one type of energy system meets societal needs more effectively than others cannot be resolved by scientists alone. These challenges must also be handled through political processes. The policy level feeds back to science, and primary stakeholders define and articulate their preferences and perceived needs.\n\nThe SLA may currently be the best framework available to individual researchers and organizations involved in R4D due to its people-centered approach, where the scientific knowledge pool is drawn upon after the research questions have been formulated in cooperation with relevant stakeholders. \nFinally, while the assumption in the linear model is for research to influence policy, policy also influences research.\n\n",

      "Key Findings": "The interaction model is regarded as the main explanatory model. It acknowledges the interactive and incremental nature of policy development, which takes place in a context and includes diversity within the groups of researchers and policymakers. This fits well in the dynamic and complex setting of local Dutch health policy.\n\nFor the conceptual framework we propose a network approach, in which we \"extend\" the interaction model. We not only focus on the one-to-one relation between an individual researcher and policymaker but include interactions between several actors participating in the research and policy process.\n\nIn this model interaction between actors in the research and the policy network is expected to improve research utilization. Interaction can obstruct or promote four clusters of barriers between research and policy: expectations, transfer issues, acceptance, and interpretation. These elements of interactions and barriers provide an actual explanation of research utilization. Research utilization itself can be measured on the individual level of actors and on a policy process level.\n\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "The developed framework has added value on existing analytical frameworks and models like Landry and\nHanney because it emphasizes more on the ‘logic’ of the context and the existing networks within this specific public health policy domain. By ‘logic’ we mean the aims, duties and responsibilities of actors from participating organizations and relations between them in the Dutch context of local health policy.\n\n The proposed conceptual framework is to be used in empirical studies about how epidemiological research progresses within the policymaking process. The primary research question in these studies is whether or not interactions will contribute to the use epidemiological research in local health policy development.\n\nFurther operationalisation of the concepts mentioned in the framework is necessary. Different contextual and key factors have to be transformed into relevant questions for actors about their position in the networks, their relations, their involvement in research, their attitude towards it and their perception and judgment on the way research was transferred\n\n",

      "Document Title": "Towards Sustainable Research Capacity Development and Research Ownership for Academic Institutes in Developing Countries: The Malawian Research Support Centre Model",
      "Key Findings": "The objective of the RSC programme was to develop a Malawian-owned RSC that would attract high-quality Malawian researchers from abroad, contribute to capacity building through a comprehensive course programme and on-the-job training opportunities, introduce GCP standards, advance Malawi’s capability to develop its own research agenda, and successfully compete for international research grants.\n\nIn the initial phase, due to unfamiliarity with the RSC concept, recruiting of the core staff from the local academic community was complicated. However, as soon as the RSC became well known in the local research community, the expatriate staff initially recruited could be replaced by scientists from the region. By year two the RSC had a well established staff base and organisational structure. \n\nWith the RSC assuming a coordination role for research in the CoM, the need for a governance framework for its operations became evident. The RSC facilitated the development of a CoM Research Policy, which set the mandate and operational scope of the RSC. The RSC also established research grants management procedures that streamlined grant administration into well defined pre- and post-award processes.\n\nOver the past four years, the CoM has experienced a rapid growth in the number of competitive international grants awarded directly to Malawian investigators. This is attributed partly to the increased visibility of research in the college and the support provided by the RSC, which has motivated academics to become involved in grant writing. The core funding for the Malawian RSC was provided by a four-year NACCAP grant (NWO-NACCAP, 2010). \n",
      "Key Recommendations": " \nThe Malawian issue are comparable to those in many other sub-Saharan African countries. An important reason for the success of the RSC is that the Malawian academic community embraced the RSC concept soon after its start. The comprehensive approach and local ownership of the RSC has appealed to a new generation of African academics, who have a growing awareness that the role of donors and guest universities from the North may need to be revisited. In most African research institutions, major research has traditionally been driven by expatriate researchers who have come as part of capacity strengthening efforts.\n\n This is evident from the few publications in which African researchers are the lead authors. Inevitably the foreign researchers dominate the local research agenda, have more skills and experience to attract international funding, and, as principal investigators, exercise intellectual ownership. An RSC-like initiative may be welcomed by other African Universities with comparable problems.\n\nFurther, the Malawian RSC core staff could play a supportive role in the initial phase of developing similar programs in the region. This has already been accomplished with the recent establishment of RSCs at the University of Zimbabwe College of Health Sciences and the University of Zambia School Of Medicine, based on the Malawian model and supported by Malawian RSC staff. \n\nIt may be time to consider developing an African RSC network in which south training and coaching is a critical component. If successful, this initiative may contribute to true sustainable research capacity building and to local research ownership.\n",

      "Key Findings": "Use of Randomization and Other Experimental and Quasi-experimental Research Designs:  In order to more reliably establish causation, REAP employs randomized interventions to help China’s authorities determine whether policies deliver desirable outcomes. Like a clinical trial in a medical setting, randomized trials involve treatment and control groups that are statistically identical. \n\nPursuit of collaboration: About a dozen researchers and programme staff at Stanford University and their counterparts at CCAP comprise the core team at REAP. This group cooperates to oversee all of REAP’s initiatives and make all strategic decisions.\n\n Pursuing Policy Relevance: We seek to only design interventions that policymakers are likely to take an interest in. If an intervention cannot be adopted or expanded as a broader policy, it is of no practical use outside of an economics journal. REAP takes several steps to ensure that its interventions maintain policy relevance.\n\n Incrementalism:\nAfter exploring opportunities and settling on an area where we can add value, we start small with a relatively limited pilot and an evaluation. After analyzing these results we will move to a larger test of a concept, often incorporating several different approaches. \n\nRobust Outreach: Part of REAP’s strategy for success is to disseminate our findings to as wide an array of audiences as possible in order to generate interest in our work. To ensure “cross border” accessibility, the majority of our outreach materials are available in both English and Chinese. REAP publicity targets three main groups: general audiences, policy makers, and academia.\n\n\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "REAP’s experience in impact evaluation can be distilled into four key recommendations.\nEmphasize Empiricism: There are thousands of government entities, private organizations, and research institutions around the world—and especially in China today—that are dedicated to solving problems for vulnerable populations. Often they are awash with money and good intentions. Yet the problems they are committed to solving persist. REAP believes this is partly because very few organizations are able to convincingly answer a fundamental question about their efforts: Do they work? Quantitative, experimental design is the best means to reliably measure success and effectively channel ideas and investments that target the world’s most pressing problems.\nLeverage Local Expertise:  Rigorous randomized impact evaluation requires the involvement of large numbers of people and intimate knowledge of local circumstances. REAP is a group of economists, some of whom are from non-Chinese institutions. \n\nFocus on the Practical: By incorporating local partners, focusing on policy relevant problems, shedding light on workable solutions, and keeping our messages simple, REAP has been able to not only produce cutting edge research results, but also deliver useful policy solutions to people that need them.\n\nCommunicate Effectively: REAP’s capacity to perform depends on sharing its results and reaching out to groups whose interests align with our capabilities. The only way to discover and leverage these synergies is to disseminate news of our work and results to as wide an audience as possible. An effective policy intervention will do no one any good if nobody knows about it.\n\n",

Policy research must be adapted to the political realities, governance challenges and capacities, and\ncomplex institutional relationships that shape policy-making processes. \nd.

In order to bring this about, existing approaches to monitoring and evaluation need to go beyond the level of outputs. \n\nFurther investments are needed to improve our understanding of how information is produced\nand used in policy processes in developing countries. Understanding these dynamics will help us to\nunderstand what donor support can achieve, and may help to provide it in a more targeted manner.\nb. Promoting democratic ownership also requires strengthening the capacity of all key actors in\nsociety to produce and use policy-relevant information.\nc.

      "Key Recommendations": "Rigorous impact evaluation is not a gold standard for monitoring and evaluation practices of NGOs. The timelines, demands and requirements of research are not responsive to the immediate and medium term needs of NGOs. Thus there are many reasons for NGOs to rely on other methods. However, impact evaluation is a very valuable methodology that contributes to organizational learning and improves accountability of many programmes. What this paper highlights is that rigorous impact evaluations deliver valuable findings but also require many resources and are difficult to organize for a relatively small NGO. It is questionable if rigorous impact evaluations should be organized by an NGO on its own.  This is because impact evaluations are costly and it is difficult to develop an organization in a way that there is a good balance between programmes and evaluations.\n\nTherefore it is recommended that organizations join forces with likeminded organizations before starting collaborations with universities and knowledge centres. Instead of evaluating the results of an individual programme, more fundamental issues can be jointly evaluated. \n",

In addition, making better use of our existing evaluation resources can further make a difference.\nSecondly, doing fewer but more rigorous quantitative, qualitative and mixed- methods evaluations and even using resources to simply strengthen implementation is sure to deliver better “value-for-money”.\n\nFinally, we must invest more in strengthening the technical capacities of our organizations in impact evaluation. Such capacity is necessary to not only effectively support programme staff to pursue innovative, yet credible, impact evaluation designs and effectively identify and manage consultants but also we have a more substantive say as a sector in shaping the current debate, particularly to avoid having things imposed that are unworkable and/or do not add value. \n",

      "Key Findings": "YPs are making significant contributions to agricultural value chains through research, however, there are other fields of development through the value chain that are not (yet) considered. Broader view into the value chain is required so as to influence policy and decision makers. \n\t\nMoreover, investment in capacity building and mentorship programmes in the agricultural value chain can also play an important role in preparing the youth to make a desired transformation in the agriculture sector. The YPs are too often not offered training in skills that can prepare them to engage with the development sector. Interaction among the YPs and with mentors/seniors; and collaboration with other professional networks such as the IWA Young Water Professionals can assist the YPs to make a valuable contribution towards development and transformation of the agricultural sector.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "- Any development strategy/policy of the southern African region should include a strong emphasis on the capacity development and transformation of its agricultural sector. These strategies should encourage youth to take advantage of the potential of new technologies to link youth to agriculture and farmers to markets along value chains. \n\n-There is a need for integrated research approach in the agricultural sector. Capacity building needs to go beyond offering research opportunities, that is, there is a need for mentorship and on the job-training programmes as well as technology and skills transfer. It is critical that development initiatives groom students and emerging professionals to contribute meaningfully to research for development. Therefore African universities need to have strong internship programmes that can prepare young people to be stronger participants in the agricultural value chains and agents of change. \n\n-Development organisation should create a space for the YPs to interact and exchange ideas and knowledge regarding relevant research, innovations, opportunities and challenges in their fields of research. This would keep them informed on progress made and information available in their respective subjects of research. \n",

      "Document Title": "How should we assess knowledge translation in research organizations; designing a knowledge translation self-assessment tool for research institutes (SATORI)",
      "Key Findings": "The pilot study conducted across 20 TUMS centres and departments showed that while conducting research and producing knowledge are performed with appropriate quality and timeliness in the university, there are significant\nweaknesses in the interactions between researchers and their research target audiences (both in selecting research priorities and transferring the results), securing the financial resources and following supportive regulations for knowledge translation activities. The comparison of the mean scores obtained in different\n domains confirmed that research capacity and knowledge production is acceptable but there are certain weaknesses in the aptitude of the last two domains of knowledge transfer and promoting the use of evidence.\nIn view of the weaknesses identified in our study, the main interventions needed for TUMS include:\n1) Facilitating knowledge translation activities\nthrough provision of financial resources required for\nthese activities;\n2) Facilitating knowledge translation activities\nthrough creating supportive and facilitating infrastructures\nfor these activities;\n3) Facilitating interactions between researchers and\ntarget audiences to exchange questions and research\nfindings.\n\nThe challenges faced by TUMS in knowledge translation issues are somewhat similar to those faced by other countries. Though many investors in developed countries financially support knowledge translation activities, and have established certain structures and regulations to strengthen knowledge translation, the interaction between researchers and target audiences is still a major concern. Most of the interventions proposed to strengthen knowledge translation, even in developed countries, focus on facilitating and enhancing the interaction between researchers and research users.\n\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "The comparison of organizational strengths and weaknesses, based on the scores gained through this questionnaire can help officials define intervention priorities.\nAlthough the establishment of an organizational unit for improving knowledge translation is a costly strategy; it may be beneficial for developing strategies to promote KT, such as designing a guideline for publishing the results, and the development of regulations to support the intellectual rights of the researchers. The following steps can help prioritize KTE interventions: \n(1) preparing a list of the statements which have obtained low scores on the self –assessment test, (2) formulating intervention options, and\n(3) assessing the organizational context and different aspects such as feasibility, cost and chance of success for\neach intervention.\n\nAnd in addition to being used in Iran’s academic environment, we believe it could be applied to other countries’ research organization settings as well. This tool covers the most important activities, necessary resources and facilitating strategies for knowledge translation at the organizational level, and similar to its\nCanadian counterpart, this tool can also be used for re-evaluation of the organization’s promotion in knowledge translation. In addition, discussion and dialogue is possible concerning each statement of the tool that could lead to identification of intervention(s) regarding weaknesses of the organization. Finally, different perspectives could be elaborated upon and considered during the prioritization of interventions, since the discussion group consists of a variety of different stakeholders including members of research councils, research managers, researchers and research users.\n\n",

      "Key Findings": "The project is assessed to have achieved a high level of efficiency. \n\t\nRAZUM Program (EUR 8.03 million): The objective of the RAZUM program was to support the development of knowledge-based SMEs with a potential to have a positive impact on economic development. The program provided loans covering up to 70 percent of new product development costs, with maximum support of EUR 1.5 million per project and duration of up to three years. \n\n•Capabilities developed that might influence subsequent R&D productivity: (i) improved\nfirm’s competitiveness internationally; (ii) increased technical capacity to conduct R&D\nextended knowledge; and (iii) increased capability of staff.\n•Expected benefits derived from commercial application of the R&D results:\n- Increased competitiveness on the international market (60% of firms);\n- Strengthened presence on the targeted markets (65% of firms);\n- Improved knowledge of the markets (75% of firms have good or excellent knowledge);\n- Improved skills for commercialization (15% of firms with excellent skills and 75% of\nfirms with good or medium skills)\n•Changes in firm behavior that resulted from having received support from RAZUM:\n•Innovation ideas were generated: 55 percent of the firms generated new ideas while\nworking on the project, but did not have enough capacity to work on other innovations and to\nengage in additional R&D activities and 35 percent managed to work on additional R&D\nactivities in parallel with the project itself.\n•R&D human capacity increase appeared to be sustainable: 80 percent of the firms intend to\nkeep the newly hired staff after the project closure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "\nA first lesson learned from the Science and Technology Project is that innovation related projects may achieve tangible results within a relative short time. STP achievements indicate that Croatia’s innovation performance was not constrained by a lack of ideas, as sometimes argued, but by the availability of appropriate institutions – such as TTOs, early-stage financing and\nmentoring services. \n\nA lesson potentially valid to several middle income countries, therefore, is that untapped sources of innovation could be unleashed provided that an adequate institutional environment is in place.\n\nA second lesson derives from factors seemingly critical for STP achievement: (i) focus on well defined, quantifiable targets (enabling commercialization of publicly funded research and\nsupporting SME investments in R&D); (ii) design of a comprehensive set of instruments targeting informational and financial bottlenecks inherent to innovation processes (TTOs and\nBICRO programs); (iii) a transparent and meritocratic governance regime of the support programs; and (iv) monitoring schemes put in place in the beginning, allowing the necessary adjustments to materialize. \n\nA third lesson can be learned from what STP could not achieve, namely: restructuring research institutes and promoting a venture capital industry. The failure in fostering restructuring of research organizations was caused by a combination of political and technical difficulties. \n\nWhile a complex political economy is to some extent inherent to any restructuring process, a technical difficulty found in STP was related to definition of the own concept of restructuring, as BI did not count with direct government support and was financially self-sustained. \n\n\n\n",

This should enable ESHPAC to reconsider its operational process and strategies on the basis of whether outcomes are in line with the intentions for achievements by the Committee. Although the primary goal of a HPAC is to promote evidence informed policymaking, the scope of the HPAC's operation might be expanded. ESHPAC envisions operating as a Knowledge Translation Platform (KTP). Given the Committee’s composition, its knowledge base, deliberative dialogues, and its involvement in capacity strengthening activities, it could also as serve as a knowledge-brokering forum. Bennett and Jessani5 noted that knowledge translation relies upon partnerships, collaborations, and personal contact between researchers and research-users, factors that are undoubtedly the bedrock of an efficient HPAC composed of researchers and policymakers. \n\nUsing ESHPAC as a KTP would be an interesting venture, as it will introduce a new dimension into the operation of the State Ministry of Health, and could further enhance the bridging mechanism between research and policy. \n\n\n",

      "Key Findings": "We describe the achievements and challenges across the four partnership goals.\n\nGoal 1: To integrate social and biomedical science research on chronic diseases of public health significance in Africa and for African communities in the UK through collaborative research between partners\nOur funding could not accommodate collaborative research and applications for funding to scale up our activities were unsuccessful.\n\nGoal 2: To influence chronic disease policies in Africa by disseminating evidence-based research and intervention to policy makers\nWe secured the participation of policymakers and donors from the Ghana’s Ministry of Health, Ghana Health Service, Malaysia’s Ministry of Health, WHO-Ghana Office, WHO-Afro, WHO, UNAIDS Nigeria\nOffice, Royal Netherlands Embassy and UK’s DFID to our 2007 workshop and 2009 and 2010 international conferences. \n\nGoal 3: To offer postgraduate teaching, training and support in Africa and in the UK on Africa-centred chronic\ndisease through teaching exchanges, research internships and co-publishing\nThe focus on teaching exchanges had to be refined because UK and African universities operated different academic schedules and it was difficult to synchronise timetables of potential visiting lecturers and host institutions without incurring significant costs. \n\nGoal 4: To disseminate partnership research and related activities to academic, health practitioner/policy and lay\naudiences through a partnership website, annual meetings and joint publications \nGoal 4 yielded the greatest consistent success. We organized two major partnership workshops in Ghana\n(NMIMR, 2007) and London (LSE, 2008) and coorganised an international conference with Monash University\nin Malaysia (2010). \n",
      "Key Recommendations": "We identified five key ingredients required to sustain our partnership that may be applicable to research partnerships generally:\n\n1. Social Capital: A basic definition of social capital is the shared understandings, values and links individuals and groups share that engender trust and collaboration. The importance of trust and mutual respect within partnerships (bonding capital) is emphasized by the majority of reflexive accounts of sustainable partnerships. Our partnership thrived, despite funding challenges, because these elements were present within our core working group. \n\n2. Measurable goals: Goals have to clearly be conceptualized, realistically costed and measurable in order to monitor and evaluate the relationships between inputs, outputs and outcomes. It helps to develop indictors for monitoring and evaluating goals at the inception stage. Beyond their utility in tracking progress, indicators also enable activities, responsibilities and expected outcomes to be transparent to all partners.\n\n3. Administrative support. Administrative support is necessary for non-technical aspects of partnership activities. Activities like organizing meetings writing reports, searching for grant proposals and developing grant proposal budgets can be time consuming and cumbersome.\n\n4. Creative and innovative strategies: Openness to new ways of using existing resources (within the group) and to securing additional resources (within and outside the group) can propel a poorly-resourced research partnership forward. \n\n5. For small scale partnerships to transition from the grant stage to the integrative stage, funding is required. The primary route is for partners to access competitive grants if they have the appropriate capacity to develop and submit proposals. \n",

      "Key Findings": "Transnational research partnerships that “emphasize the process of collective knowledge generation … have the extra advantage of bringing comparative and cross-cultural perspectives to bear on local situations”. In the current transforming context of transnational partnerships, organizational participants will experience liberating disorder, uncertainty, surprises, and positive fluctuations as they learn new roles, embrace multiple perspectives and serendipitous opportunities, and explore creative means of service provision and problem solving. Among THEPs, the asymmetrical rules that previously governed research and development-project relationships are being obliterated and replaced with more complex and turbulent symmetrical norms and requirements.\n\nGlobal economic crisis coupled with overstretched university resource bases suggest the possibility of amplification in the symmetrical trajectory of transnational research and development governance. New and expanding challenges in a temporal context of resource limitations highlight the “opportunity for a new imagination” that is focused on sustainable development and public engagement and realized through mutually beneficial THEPs that are “freed from the stifling neo-liberal orthodoxy of the past decades”.\n\nBuilding human capabilities by empowering people to realize their full potential and enlarge their range of choices stimulates innovation and resilience, enhances the ability of representatives of Southern countries to negotiate effectively and steer governance arenas, and facilitates the realization of glocal development objectives. While THEPs carry transaction costs, they pool and share assembled essential resources, spread risks, apply complementary core competencies, enhance the bridging social capital of participants, and facilitate the leveraging of contributions and support from non-academic sources. \n\n\n\n\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "While the symmetrical path to process and outcome transformations in research and development governance is vulnerable to exhaustion or regression, there are ample opportunities for amplification of its emerging features.\nAlthough “traces of universal standards that attach value to whole system needs can be discerned in the turbulent flow” of symmetrical THEP activity, institutional-capacity and human-capability-building projects typically remain protected “islands of excellence”. \n\nPartnership roles and influence demand constant vigilance when funding sources are asymmetrical. There are real risks, for instance, that the research gap between North and South could widen and deepen even further. In a symmetrical North–South THEP relationship, power need not be symmetrical because the Northern university “may have a variety of reasons for not employing all the power resources at its command …”. However, participant, especially managerial, responses must be symmetrical and reconcile discontinuous change pulses.\n\nIn sum, THEPs are “fraught with instabilities which are likely to produce conflict …” while embedded with possibility for becoming “very productive”. In the vulnerable glocal governance context of complexity and turbulence, the management of THEPs requires keen anticipatory skills and functional and emotional transnational-competence-capability building.\n",

Since the evidential needs of the iodine case deliberations were specifically related to appropriate formulation and dosage, a rapid review appears to be a suitable approach to support policymaking in this instance.",

      "Key Recommendations": "There is much to be learned from the development research policy and practice in England over the last two and a half decades, and from experiences of research, development and innovation in the NHS in England. Such learning needs to draw on insights from the growing research literature on knowledge creation, communication and application in organizational set tings and complex systems. For other countries considering reforms in this area, we hope that the analysis in this paper is helpful, particularly in situating health research and knowledge mobilization in the wider context of the health system. We conclude that we should seek to create health care organizations which have competence and capacity in both research and knowledge mobilization. \n\nHealth care organizations need to be able to combine a 'producer' model in which they undertake research to their local knowledge both use themselves and to export to other organizations; with a 'consumer' actively seek out relevant meet local knowledge of working locally, their own services; other organizations require a supra-organizational nationally on research an international collaboration. These are not alternatives, but complementary components of a balanced, pragmatic, local and national organizational strategy for research and knowledge mobilization\n",

      "Document Title": "On the Use of FTAs: A Review of Research Methodologies",
      "Key Findings": "Studies that contend that FTAs are more widely used seem to have some methodological problems. Baldwin’s figure (3%) is a utilization rate, which is naturally on the low side. Cheong\n(2008, p. 3) argues that the level of use of AFTA was as high as 30%–50% in 2006 in the case of Thailand when no MoP trade was excluded from the analysis, but also contends that this finding on the frequency of use of AFTA and Baldwin‘s observation\nare consistent. \nPomfret et al. (2010) study shows that the selection of indicators is critical in assessing the level of use of FTAs. The utility rate of all FTAs examined was above 80%, three of which recorded levels higher than 90%. Thus, as long as the MFN rate is positive, FTAs are widely used. \n\nThe comparison of the studies on the use of ATFTA by Pomfret et al. and Chirathivat (2008) gives us some ideas on the issue of upward bias inherent with C/O data. The former study examines the utilization rate of ATFTA using Australia‘s import data and finds that the rate is around 55% in 2008, while the latter study finds that the utilization of ATFTA is as high as 72% in 2008, using Thailand‘s C/O data. \n\nFinally, many firm surveys are hindered by the counting problem described in the previous section. There is a need to design and conduct more methodologically sound firm surveys in the future to draw meaningful policy implications.\n\n\n\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "Several items should be included in any future research agenda. First, detailed data collection and examination of various imports in terms of tariff structure and the use of\nFTAs should be conducted at the bilateral level, using actual import data. \n\nSecond, careful examination of dutiable imports without a MoP, namely Portion D (MFN rate = FTA rate > 0), is necessary. It is critically important to know why there is no MoP.\nThird, in terms of data sources, there is an urgent need to verify the upward bias that C/O data may have compared against the import side data. Because traders can easily obtain C/O for exports that are not ultimately exported and/or inflate the value of exports written in the C/O certificate, which is allowed for business flexibility, accurately measuring the use of FTAs using C/O data is becoming difficult.  Thus, it is critical to understand the magnitude of the growing upward bias of C/O data, if researchers opt to use C/O data to examine FTA use. There is a possibility that what is actually facilitated is the issuance of a C/O, not the use of FTAs.\nA carefully crafted survey should be conducted to identify the reasons for not using FTAs.\nExisting surveys have several methodological problems, such as asking the question ―do you use FTAs? without specifying which FTAs.\n Finally, what is important is the welfare implications of FTAs, not the use or non-use of FTAs. \n\n\n",

      "Document Title": "Empirical Determinants and Patterns of Research and Development Investment in Asia",
      "Key Findings": "Results show that the sensitivity of R&D spending to internal funds availability is systematically related to firm characteristics that make it more likely to face financing constraints. Tables 7 and\n8 show significant positive coefficients on interaction variables between cash flow and the dummies for age and size.\n\nYounger and smaller firms, which are more likely to face financing frictions and pay higher external financing costs, tend to have higher cash flow sensitivity than older and larger firms which can more easily tap debt and equity markets. The results are robust across the different specifications.\n\nThe study also finds that the greater the direct share of the domestic owner in a firm, or the higher the ownership concentration, the lower is the sensitivity of R&D spending to changes in the level of internal funds as reflected by operational cash flow (significantly negative parameters of the interaction terms in Tables 9 and 10). This suggests greater commitment of controlling shareholders to the longer-term prospects of the firm—e.g., greater willingness to fund R&D—with a bigger in the company.\nIn the same way, foreign ownership of a firm tends to lower cash flow sensitivity of R&D investment, suggesting greater stability of funding for innovation research (Tables 11 and 12).\nAs in Arikawa, Kawanishi, and Miyajima (2011) for Japan, we find little evidence of myopic behavior of foreign investors that could possibly lead them to under-invest in technology\n\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "Debt is the more dominant source of external financing based on our empirical findings, while equity financing seemingly plays only a tiny role. This contrast with results in advanced economies outside of Asia, where financial markets are deeper and specialized markets exist.\n\nIn the context of alternative uses of funds, we do not find strong evidence of financialization of Asian non financial firms, as the measurement of dividend payments in the paper may have affected the results, while financial investment (i.e., investment in financial instruments) appears to be positively rather than negatively related to R&D spending.\n\nOverall, there does not seem to be a shift in preference of firm shareholders for shorter term financial gains at the expense of longer-term real investment and future productivity.\nHowever, financially constrained firms can clearly gain with better access to external financing for R&D.\n",

      "Key Findings": "•\tConditional cash transfers increase school enrolment and attendance, but have no overall impact on children’s test scores (though the evidence base is not that broad for learning outcomes).\n•\tSchool fees subsidies improve enrolment and progress in school, while merit-based scholarships increase learning.\n•\tDistributing teaching and learning aids in school has no impact on school attendance and language test scores of children. However, computer-based learning offered in addition to the regular school curriculum has positive impacts on mathematics test scores.\n•\tInvesting in additional teachers, new schools, early childhood development programmes, community-based school management and school-feeding programmes looks promising in boosting schooling outcomes.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "The evidence shows that providing materials had no impact on school attendance or language test scores. The evidence counters the argument that providing materials works to draw more students into the classroom by providing an incentive. Some interventions seem ineffective because studies pooled together found no significant results. However, decisions about the effectiveness of these interventions should be made with caution, given the limited number of studies. \nFurther, there were several promising interventions e.g. teacher resources, new school buildings, CCTs, early childhood development interventions, school based management and school feeding programmes all had significant positive effects on schooling outcomes but more studies are needed to confirm these findings. \nThe final caveat is that few of the studies reviewed were carried out with difficult- to – reach populations. New approaches need be tried and tested for these groups. \n",

      "Key Recommendations": "To achieve equitable in-country access, parallel investment in health policy and systems research, which does not necessarily fall within the scope of PDP activities, is likely to be required to overcome health system barriers to high-volume delivery.\nGerminal research is being performed by PDPs in relation to the availability, affordability, and adoption of their products, which might be scaled up in the future.\n\nUltimately, MMV and DNDi, in particular, are better than the pharmaceutical industry at developing novel and inexpensive products for neglected diseases and at supporting access to their products. Although this suggests that PDPs should not limit their role to product development, they may need to clarify or redefine the scope of their access activities in relation to other global health partnerships. \n\nTo assist PDPs to identify where their comparative advantage lies and how far their role in access should extend, their access and delivery achievements should be compared with those of the Global Fund and UNITAID. \n\nFinally, DNDi needs to better align its activities with its capacity building objective. If the long-term intention is to promote the development of independent, competitive research institutions and scientists in LMICs, this may require changing the nature of the HAT platform and the Leishmaniasis East Africa Platform and their evaluation indicators. Although MMV appears to be meeting its limited capacity-building goals, it should adopt a broader approach that aims to enhance LMIC research systems. \n",

      "Key Findings": "While the use of e-learning as an educational delivery mechanism is still nascent in sub-Saharan Africa, experience from this program shows that it has high potential to reach out to a large number of learners with limited resource costs. However, the problem of slow internet connectivity and difficult access to the internet, at times, frustrate the learners and demotivate them to participate in e-learning. \nThis pilot course also provided the lesson that the course should span at least eight weeks in order to allow participants to develop the proposal concurrently as part of the learning process. In addition to the proposal development course, the participants also brought up the demand for courses such as measuring impact, detailed data analysis techniques and methodology, and using econometric and statistical software for data analysis. \n\nFurther research is needed to identify the best combinations of e-learning and the face-to face program, best mode of delivery, best combinations of reading materials and the discussion sessions, and ways to improve motivation among the distance learners. In this context, the importance of promoting opportunities for developing course contents as open educational resources and using them effectively in the distance education programs cannot be overemphasized.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "-Designers of the e-learning programs need to fully understand the background and the needs of the learners in order to increase the relevance and the utility of the program. Matching the skills needs with the content could optimize the learning speed and make the learning process effective. \n\n-Make the learning program user friendly: Adult learners are increasingly becoming accustomed to internet based learning platforms. Yet efforts to increase the user friendliness of the e-learning modules can help reduce the fear of the technology and focus on the content of learning. \n-Learners have varying degrees of absorptive capacity depending on their ways of learning. One way to reach out to all learners is to provide a variety of learning activities that cater to different types of learners. Modules should help visual and auditory learners. \n\n-Self- motivation remains a major challenge in an e-learning program. There is need for constant attention to inclusion of activities that bring the participants to the course and reward them for their efforts. This is a particular challenge in the courses that do not offer credits that could be used towards larger accomplishments such as a diploma or a degree. \nFinally, flexibility of course schedule is crucial for the learners of different speed to catch up with the course content offered at various points in time. Spreading the course assignments throughout the course period gives an opportunity for the moderators to be in regular touch with the participants and increases the active engagement of the participants. \n",

Collaboration and the time taken to achieve measurable outcomes can be a challenge. However, within the current north-south collaboration, the vision to build research capacity was mutual as it was one of the IOP goals of the south institution. \nThe initial results suggest that the south institution was challenged in terms of staff capacity and thus a critical mass of productive researchers was needed.\nThrough this north-south collaboration, members of the collaboration were able to develop intra- and inter-disciplinary partnerships that resulted in maximizing the capacity-building efforts. The exposure to this collaboration improved both individual and institutional research capacity in the south.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "There is a growing acknowledgement that Africa’s future rests with the development of its intellectual and human capital through strong capacity-building programmes and systems in higher education and the development of locally relevant and applicable research and innovation structures.\n\n The findings of the study illustrate the extent to which the research capacity objectives can be achieved through a north-south partnership. The fact that the southern counterparts were able to articulate their needs and use the partnership as a vehicle to address those needs is a definite positive of the model. This is consistent with the recommendation in the literature that north-south collaborative projects are some of the avenues through which the research capacity development objectives can be achieved",

      "Key Findings": "Propensity score matching analyses shows that the R4D program has statistically significant positive effects on household participation in cassava markets, adoption of improved varieties and crop management practices and household food adequacy. R4D does not have a statistically significant effect on yields and gross margins. The tests conducted suggest that bias due to selection on unobservables may not be severe enough to invalidate the impact estimates. Bias may still be a problem that is present in the analysis. But there is evidence based on the tests that it may not be a substantial issue in this case",
      "Key Recommendations": "The finding that controlling for observables the program has positive effects of treatment on some short-term outcomes implies that policymakers can increase impacts on long-term outcomes. Policy makers can promote R4D programs by first expanding farmers’ access to markets, then increasing availability and farmers’ access to disease-free clean planting materials of improved high yielding varieties that are resistant to diseases and pests, disseminating improved crop management and post-harvest management technologies, increasing farmers’ organizations, knowledge and skills to increase on-farm yields and profits and improving extension, marketing and infrastructure services. There is a need to promote the program even if it does not statistically significantly increase yields and profits in the short term because these outcomes depend on other pre-conditions such as farmer knowledge and skills, farmers’ organizations, effective farm gate prices and infrastructure. It is difficult for policy makers to develop these prerequisites the short term.\n\nAlthough the program does not have a statistically significant effect on yields and profits, the significant program effects\non market participation, variety adoption, and food adequacy merit further promotion of the program since these positive outcomes tend to be pre-conditions for realizing long-term yield and profit benefits. Future studies need to collect panel data and to apply panel data methods to control for the many unobservable characteristics in order to more rigorously assess the causal impact of R4D on yields and profits.\n",

Work building on theatrical metaphors has shown that there are differences between strict front stage boundaries and back stage processes of collaboration. Other research highlighted how scientific advisory work consists of both delineating and transgressing boundaries and that actors involved in such collaborations use both contingent strategies of inclusion and rationalist strategies of exclusion. Further, it shows that there are often boundary configurations of science and policy actors rather than predefined boundaries between science and policy, and finally, that policy makers can also be involved in theoretical discussions, whereas researchers also use political skills.\nOne of the most interesting elements a co-production framework is able to emphasize in such collaborations is how actors try to find a balance between dilemmas that are often unsolvable. Within collaborative settings, the actors involved need to maintain a precarious balance between the multiple and often competing criteria or accountability demands from different principals they are confronted with. This co-production inspired analysis of the ‘Healthy in the City’ project showed that dealing with multiple accountability demands involves more than the ‘bridging’ of different domains, but rather involves the active and strategic (re)construction of malleable and fluid science-policy boundaries. Finally, through the ‘lens’ of co-production one can make more sense of such apparent inconsistencies or contradictions. This perspective shows that the distinction between what counts as ‘science’ and what counts as ‘policy’ is only one side of the story.\n",

      "Key Findings": "The LP revealed many features of the AFSI programme logic which failed a systemic coherence test.  Australian funders and researchers can be considered as observers who bring their politics and theories of change to the collaborative situation. They face local people at programme and project level who also have their politics and theories of change.\n\nAcross these various people, there are also the differing cultural traditions of researchers and administrators which are in turn shaped by each researcher’s own organizational context. To succeed, programme or project-based R4D must be capable of creating an effective performance amongst these multiple actors just like the players in a new band or orchestra. This relational dynamic is central to systemic coherence.\nThere was lack of clarity as to whether the LP was, part of the monitoring and evaluation (M&E) process or not, and this situation was never really resolved. Ultimately each was conceived of, assessed and resourced quite separately. Formal M&E tools and processes for AFSI had been developed with, and agreed upon by partners (DFAT, CORAF/WECARD and BecA) prior to the start of the LP. Subsequently there was very little engagement by CSIRO researchers assigned to AFSI projects with the AFSI programme-level M&E.\n\nWhile it was envisaged that the LP would allow Australian AFSI participants to add to the formal agreed M&E processes from their learning, this input did not eventuate. We learnt that M&E should be conceived of and conceptualized as a learning process, as elucidated in the discussion\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "Requisite institutional change for systemic innovation is not likely from any single initiative. The role and impact of leadership appear to be critical, and a better understanding of this is warranted as part of generating conditions that support institutional change. We conclude that the following are also required: \n(i) appreciating or understanding the institutional landscape and its complexity,\n(ii) appreciating which institutions constrain and which enable, and (iii) knowing how to institutionalize\nfindings/learning – that is, project/programme\nsustainability.\n\nFinally, a key challenge for both future studies and practice is to gain a much clearer understanding of the political economy of prevailing conservatism and to identify ways of institutionalizing systemic learning as part and parcel of the research and innovation process. Without progress in this direction, the power of science for the greater good of society will continue to be undermined.\n",

      "Key Recommendations": "A mixed method approach can contribute to improving the quality of the evaluation—and indeed the program design itself—by enhancing the accuracy of the empirical claims being made regarding the intervention’s impact (or lack thereof), explanations of why and how such impact was achieved (or not), and the likelihood that others implementing a ‘similar’ project could expect comparable results elsewhere, in the future, or at a larger scale. The particular ‘comparative advantage’ of qualitative methods is understanding the idiosyncrasies of the context in which an intervention is being implemented; how outcomes are influenced by this context provides a crucial entry point for policy makers and practitioners seeking to more accurately assess and improve the effectiveness of development initiatives, of all kinds. \n\nHaving an array of methodological tools in one’s kit is the best response to the many contingencies, problems and setbacks that are an evaluator’s constant companion. One need not be an ‘expert’ in all of these methods—indeed, this is highly unlikely even after a full research career—but one can at least recognize the strengths and weaknesses, and virtues and limits, of any singular approach, and seek to offset these by calling upon others who have the complementary skills (and temperaments) required. Just as professionals ranging from carpenters to surgeons seek to use the right instrument for the right problem—and do not regard, for example, a hammer as inherently “more rigorous” than a screwdriver—so too must evaluators of development interventions. \n\n",

      "Key Findings": "We find that doing impact evaluation has large, positive, and significant effects on project implementation, especially when measured against plans. Moving from project design to implementation is an arduous process. During the period before midterm, or about two-thirds of the way into projects’ implementation, projects are delayed, in the average quarter having cumulatively disbursed at a rate that is only around half of what they had planned (15 instead of 29 percent of loan size). \n\nThe estimates for the effect of the IE, in this context, have high economic significance. To midterm, the effect size accounts for two-fifths (40.8 percent) increase in average cumulative disbursements, significant at 1 percent level. The planned to actual disbursements gap is reduced by one-half (54 percent, significant at 1 percent level), an 8 percentage point effect that helps realign projects to their planned implementation path. These effects should be not affected by sector composition, because we are using the sample of projects that reached midterm and for quarters up to midterm. Indeed, when compared to the disbursement path of other projects in the same sector, the IE increases project disbursements by 40 percent, significant at 1 percent level. \nIn short, doing IE seems to be a powerful tool to move projects from design to implementation.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "\nWe find that impact evaluation has large and significant effects on the disbursements of World Bank projects, increasing the average level of quarterly disbursements by 40 percent by midterm, helping projects reduce delays relative to plan by half, and increasing by 40 percent project disbursements relative to the average in the typical project in the same sector.\nWe conclude that projects with IE are more likely to implement their activities as planned and, in so doing, are more likely to achieve their objectives. This is of significance for both the Bank and development policy. For the Bank, the introduction of IE might help avert the need to push disbursements out toward the latter half of project duration, or to restructure and cancel nonperforming projects. It can also help manage the potential reputational risk of committing funding without being able to secure their disbursements. \nA more general implication of this work is that the development community overall may be under-investing in the type of research that has positive externalities on development investments, thus forsaking the opportunity to increase developmental effectiveness. \nFinally, our results question the notion that impact evaluation is solely a knowledge-generating public good, and puts a value to the use of impact evaluation as a private good.  If IE has public and private good features, then the case for what constitutes knowledge generation value and who should contribute to IE financing could be investigated. Future research can help better inform this debate. \n\n",

      "Key Findings": "The review found that, in the decade 2004–2013, a surge in peer reviewed outputs relating specifically to indigenous tobacco control commenced in 2008. This surge probably reflects the extent of the research response after the 2004–2005 Australian National Tobacco Strategy four years previously, which identified the need for tailored approaches to reduce tobacco use among disadvantaged groups, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.\n\nA reduction in tobacco use by 2018 has been identified as the highest priority in addressing Indigenous disadvantage in health outcomes. Translation of research into policy and action must be accelerated to achieve these important goals. Overall, there has not been a systematic or explicit approach to research translation in the design and implementation of the research being done and reported, a deficit which should be addressed to assist with the needed acceleration of research translation.\n\nIn order to translate research findings to action in the public health domain, there is a need for effective research, that is, that which trials interventions in a real- world context. However, intervention studies remain costly and require considerable time and effort to develop and implement. A 2008 review of public health research outputs suggested that funding issues have influenced these outputs.\n\nThe literature reviewed contains many descriptive studies, the numbers of which are increasing, despite longstanding calls for a better balance with more intervention studies. A more strategic use of descriptive studies could be to focus them on discussing the more novel, ground-breaking topics.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "•\tResearch efforts should encompass the geographical and cultural diversity of Australia’s Indigenous peoples\n• Adequately resourced and well-designed intervention studies with a focus on efficacy are prioritized including those incorporating multiple baseline designs, participatory action and realist evaluation approaches\n• Greater investment is made by states and territories for research to inform specific Indigenous tobacco control measures study proposals are more strongly aligned with previously identified and emerging research priorities, for example, trials of prevention of smoking uptake by Indigenous youth\n• There is continuation of regular national research priority forums representative of a wider range of knowledge users including policy-makers, practitioners and community-level stakeholders\n• Structured integrated research translation approaches are included in study designs and evaluations with dissemination strategies that enhance opportunities for knowledge exchange with decision-makers\n• There is critical review of research translation components to develop a method of appraisal of both their use and impacts\n• There is further research that specifically examines the barriers and facilitators for evidence translation into health policy and practice.\n",

      "Document Title": "Impact evaluation and policy decisions: where are we?: A Latin American think tank perspective",
      "Key Findings": "The study finds that impact evaluations are of increasing interest to the Peruvian public sector, although the greater demand is still for process evaluations. The preference for the process evaluation is associated to the fact that its focus is more directly linked to the everyday tasks and preoccupations of public officials and implementers, making it easier to grasp. \n\nResearchers also perceive that public sector officials are incorporating the language of impact evaluation, albeit mostly among top-level officers. However, use of evidence is still limited and quite heterogeneous across sectors. This evidence suggests that much more can be achieved to support impact evaluations in influencing programme and policy decisions. \nOut of the 37 studies conducted by experts from Latin American research centres, we find that only a small portion manage to influence programme or policy decisions, based on researchers’ perceptions: only about one in every four studies has managed to have any influence. \n\nMoreover, we find that the ‘influential’ studies share at least two of the following desirable features: intense contact with the implementer from the evaluation design stage, experimental designs, powerful external validity and publication of results. However, having these features is not sufficient to achieve influence. Even among impact evaluations characterised by intense contact with programme officers at the design stage, an experimental design and external validity judged strong by the researcher, only half achieved any influence on decisions related to the programme. \n\n\n\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "Knowledge from evaluations may take time to filter into policy, but it sometimes does. However, a competent public sector that is able to identify and use evidence from impact evaluations to reform programmes is a prerequisite, and take-up of results to inform policymaking is still quite low. \n\nEven among studies that shared desirable features – such as intense contact with the policymaker or implementer from the study design stage, an experimental design and a self-reported (by the researcher) powerful external validity – only half managed to influence programmatic decisions. A qualitative approach suggests that the evidence-based policymaking dream – of researchers providing the evidence policymakers need and demand in order to implement wiser policies – is unrealistic. Research and policymaking follow different processes, each with its own logic, motivation and timing. Consequently, research and policymaking cannot be expected to fit well or adapt to one another harmoniously. \n\nIt is also important to understand that not all public interventions are appropriate for an impact evaluation. Given the considerable cost – in time, funds and expertise – evaluation questions should be approached more strategically. Collaboration between researchers and policymakers in the task of formulating such questions would also benefit the cause of better policies. Added to these considerations, some evaluations may not be of current interest, although they may be taken up eventually to inform policy. \nOverall, we find opportunities for policy-relevant impact evaluations in two areas: programme expansion or design of new components for ongoing interventions and underutilised administrative data.\n",

Instead it has come as local officials recognize the capacity to stymie regulation and are able to develop mechanisms that address the technological gaps and uncertainties associated with changing technologies, typically with a combination of informational resources and programs that alter the economic incentives for upgrading. \n\nIn each case of partial compliance, this process moved from 1) the issuance of the regulation to 2) the recognition by local officials that compliance would not occur without programs that addressed the economic concerns of the producers to 3) the development of alternatives to direct command and control mechanisms.\nMost importantly, the structure of clusters matters for the effective brokerage of information between the state and the private sector. Enterprises that are clustered in fewer communities wield greater capacity to shape the regulation of their markets at the federal level. \n\nAt the local level, these cases demonstrate that small enterprises have a host of methods that can be effectively deployed to resist market-altering policies. These forms of resistance are reminiscent of James Scott’s (1985) notion of “everyday forms of resistance,” which he ascribes to peasants who resist authority without overt opposition. \n",

      "Key Findings": "\nThe overall result can be summarized as a systemic failure. The inquiry team noted how the research community was encouraged from the outset to visit and use the wiki as part of a regular practice of reflection and collaborative learning and could feed into M&E of the overall R4D initiative.\nThe requirement for an online platform was established through the contracting process, involved a limited number of mainly CSIRO staff and surfaced tensions between different perspectives on the perceived value of a LP. Despite initial effort to scope how the wiki could be used in research situations (discussed for instance, at a workshop involving all AFSI participants, held in late 2011), CSIRO staff perceived themselves at the start to hold limited stakes in the wiki.\n\nThe LP was approved as a low-risk project by a human research ethics committee (initially at Monash and then also in CSIRO). To further satisfy the Monash ethics procedures, the LP had to be designed to engage those involved in AFSI on a voluntary basis so as to avoid participation through coercion, although it was accepted that it was important for CSIRO to learn how to improve use of online environments to interface between research and practice, and how to engage stakeholders located at multiple locations and within different organizations. \n\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "Designing online spaces for collaboration is a complex process; there can be great disparity between original design ideas and what eventuates in practice. An obvious way to reduce the disparity is to include users in the design process, including also external research organizations, project recipients and collaborative partners. \n\nIn the experience discussed, this was only partly achieved and began with what can be now understood as the wrong institutional ecology and conceptual understanding, with unexpressed prior epistemological commitments. We recommend agricultural researchers nonetheless dedicate time to critically assess and customize online technologies to facilitate a shared learning environment, and reflect on how design choices influence whether or not online participation becomes a part of everyday research practice. Collaborative negotiation of ethical protocols would seem a necessary collateral undertaking, to situate ethical practice appropriately and to learn about designing an ethical framework aligned with researching principles and praxis.\n\t\nKnowledge management practices to enable joint analysis, tagging data, and analysing project narratives also would need to be established at the outset. It would also seem helpful to avoid a predetermined structure and engage facilitators to offer their interpretations back to the community for discussion, mentor adoption of online roles displaying diverse collaborative and learning capacities, and nurture social relations to build trust online and offline as part of a ‘seamless’ learning system, rather than framing the online environment as a differentiated space disconnected from offline research practices and social relations. \n\n\n",

The agency should intensify use of its expanded evaluation methodologies to identify lessons from such programs in creating and sustaining collaborations with developing country researchers and institutions.\n- USAID should bring together STI experts from pillar bureaus, the Lab, missions, and the host countries to share information on available STI resources.  \n- USAID and the Department of State should seek clearer guidance from the White House on technical possibilities for reporting STI+P expenditures. USAID leadership should choose a single option to quantify its STI+P investments and lead an inventory of STI+P-related investments in developing countries across all federal agencies, which would help inform its own and other agencies’ efforts.\n- USAID should set up formal and informal exchanges to strengthen STI+P coordination and share expertise. For example, USAID could establish, through Interagency Personnel Agreements or other mechanisms, a way for USAID staff to have short-term or long-term assignments in other agencies to understand their expertise and constraints.\n- USAID should expand incentives for mission and Washington staff to systematically incorporate science, technology, and innovation approaches as they develop programs and projects. \nCareer development and advancement opportunities should also recognize individual risk taking and initiative around STI.\n- USAID should develop clear guidelines on the intensity of evaluation for each kind of programmatic activity, incorporating appropriate M&E tools that would help project developers to better calibrate their investments with an appropriate balance between cost burden and potential program gains.\n\n",

      "Key Recommendations": "Research can only make genuine contributions to crop productivity if it is carried out in close association with farming communities, testing technologies as much as possible under their management and in their own fields and integrating farmer feedback into subsequent research. \n\nSecondly, functioning institutions such as input supply systems, credit mechanisms, land tenure policies, and produce markets play a major role in making technologies work for smallholder farmers in SSA. \n\nThird, research must begin at the real farm, through rapid characterization of the target area by cost effective\nmethods to gain a preliminary insight in the environmental and socio-economic conditions of smallholder farming and its current farming practices. The role of particular crops, animals, practices, and technologies in the farming system must be understood.  \n\nNew methods such as network analysis can be used to identify partners who are most influential and most closely associated with the farming community, through whose network technologies can eventually be disseminated.\n\nFourth, platforms for interaction and integration of the various partners’ activities should continue to be used and made more effective, as a tool for prioritizing the research agenda and defining the role of all stakeholders, in line with their competences. \nFinally, multi-stakeholder innovation platforms should not be used as ‘silver bullet’. For example, when the constraint for the adoption of soil improvement technologies is of institutional nature  more direct and targeted engagement of finance partners, market partners and government bodies can lead to faster impacts.\n\n",

      "Key Findings": "The type of intervention is R4D as defined in Chapter 1, i.e. research plays a central role and aims to contribute to diverse livelihood outcomes, and diverse stakeholders participate in MSP decision making. The multi-stakeholder engagement modality is a platform, i.e. there are explicit mechanisms for research and non-research stakeholders to engage in the collective efforts of problem solving and decision making on a structured basis.\nThe implications of the thesis may be applicable to MSP cases beyond those satisfying these three conditions. However, extrapolation of the implications to such cases needs further validation studies. Below, I first discuss the implications for studying MSPs in the context of R4D interventions, followed by implications for the implementation of MSPs in the context of R4D interventions.\n\t\nThe thesis proposes a theory of change that provides an important basis for advancing further research on how MSPs contribute to R4D interventions.\nThe lack of a comprehensive framework that considers the dynamic aspects of MSP process outputs (collaboration, knowledge exchange, influence) and their drivers (participation, engagement, learning, shared understanding) was the first obstacle with which I had to deal in conducting the thesis research. As discussed in detail in Chapter 2, I developed a working generic theory of change based on a review of the MSP literature that presents the important interrelated outputs and outcomes, as well as assumptions about how these together influence the contribution of MSPs to R4D intervention performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "\nDo multi-stakeholder platforms work? Was the core question that made me curious enough to start the thesis research approximately four years ago. At that time, there were substantial investments in MSPs, and they were considered a tool that would transform the dynamics of R4D interventions. \nAfter three years of empirical research including many direct observations on the ground, I argue that expectations regarding the contribution of MSPs to R4D intervention performance have been overstated. \n\nThis thesis research has clearly shown that MSPs can improve some process drivers (i.e. shared understanding and learning) and can trigger positive changes in knowledge exchange. However, it also concludes that MSPs do not have a major impact on participation and engagement and do not lead to increased collaboration or influence spread. At the same time, the achievement of the kinds of livelihood outcomes and livelihood impacts to which R4D interventions typically aspire is unlikely to materialize without the broad participation and engagement of highly influential actors in the private and the public sector. Hence, the dynamics in and around the MSPs studied were incompatible with the transformative objectives of the R4D interventions. This means that MSPs can play a meaningful role in R4D interventions, but we need to be modest and realistic about what they can and cannot achieve. \n\n",

      "Document Title": "How does the context of research influence the use of educational research in policy-making and practice?",
      "Key Findings": "The results reveal that research utilisation is a complex process, and the participants recognised that a series of variables can have great impact on their work. Tailoring research to users, the existence of funding and other resources, mechanism of access to beneficiaries and collaboration are all critical to pushing research up and out of the university context.\n\nIn the first place, the study identifies who are the perceived users of educational research and reveals the students as main beneficiaries, together to school teachers and colleagues from academia. Research is produced and delivered to students; this insight can help us understand the context of research production in Romania, which is centred on a model of academia that\nprioritises teaching as a university mission. \nSecondly, the study focuses on the factors influencing the research use, among which the access of resources and funding appear as critical issues. As in other national contexts, in Romania, the main sources of funding are the national government and public European funds. \n\nThirdly, the study identifies the role of research collaborative communities to foster the research uptake in practice. Academics perceive benefits for academic progress and social benefits in terms of social contribution. Research partnerships represent a key point for academic researchers, and these partnerships are seen by researchers as opportunities to enhance their own results and to close the gap between theory and practice. \nThis position allows us to consider partnerships between researchers, policy makers and practitioners as a priority for any educational reform agenda.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "This study has implications for higher education institutions, policy makers and practitioners as users who are engaged with research. First, research producers, such as higher education institutions, must adopt research as part of their mission and priority, promoting institutional measures and organisational cultures that support research and users’ priorities.\n\nThe research culture in the Romanian higher education system remains in transition from teaching-based values to research-intensive environments. Second, to succeed, initial and continuous training with a strong research component are required. Academics must understand the priorities of policy makers and practitioners and craft their research accordingly.\n\nThis process draws attention to the professional identity of academics and shifts their work paradigm from teaching to teaching and research; alternatively, it includes only research intensive profiles.\nTranslating educational research is a complex process and requires a balance between researchers’ own research and disciplinary interests and the agendas of policy makers and practitioners. Harmonising these two contexts is difficult and, as Levin (2011) recognised, translation activities are sometimes poorly understood in the academic social sciences. In parallel with research-production actions, policy makers and practitioners must provide researchers with opportunities for interaction, knowing that their partnership is crucial for influencing policy and practice within the educational field. Strategic dialogue between research production and research use is still needed to overcome these barriers.\n\n\n",

      "Key Findings": "The study findings show that when partnership activities are located in regions with greater knowledge spillovers and R&D competition, partners are more likely to craft formal contractual safeguards and procedures to support their collaborative agreements. This result is consistent with previous findings that competitive conditions that escalate the potential losses from spillovers and imitation might cast a shadow on firms’ location and sourcing choices\n\nAlthough we do not address the location choice question, our findings are broadly in accord with the argument that firms operating in a cluster safeguard their knowledge by how they organize their knowledge creating activities.\n\nSecond, the study teases out two related sources of personal interactions that contribute to governance externalities when partnership activities are located in a cluster. We find that the greater the employment density of individuals in the focal industry, the lower is the likelihood of formal contractual procedures to deal with adaptation. \n\nThird, the study provides evidence that greater intensity of professional association membership also reduces the incidence of formal governance mechanisms. Institutions with greater presence in a region might not only facilitate the development of strong linkages among professionals in a sector but also promote common norms that enable social ordering and help mitigate transactional adaptation concerns.\nFinally, our evidence of negative relationships between formal governance mechanisms and employment density as well as the thickness of institutional relationships suggests that firms treat the relational governance features of agglomeration as a substitute for formal contractual provisions.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "The study explicitly focuses on the oversight and safeguarding role of formalized contractual provisions. It would therefore be valuable to investigate and assess the extent to which agglomerations influence other functions such as coordination by offering informal governance support to formal contracts that underpin inter-organizational relationships. \n\nSecond, the results imply that cluster locations with strong R&D competition might drive partners to choose equity structures to govern a partnership. Although formal administrative control and termination rules represent important instruments for addressing ex post concerns in contractual alliances, firms have other alternatives to efficiently govern their partnerships.\n\nThird, an important implication of the findings of the paper is that Marshallian forces exert both positive and negative governance externalities. Although the study has not investigated the outcomes of alliances, future research may also examine how the structuring of such external corporate activities potentially mediates the relationship between agglomeration and performance, a continuing theme of agglomeration studies.\n \nFinally, the performance of firms may not be limited to traditional metrics, such as long term financial performance, but may also include innovative outcomes and new product launches. Future research can examine the implications of agglomeration externalities for how buyers and suppliers structure their linkages for enhancing joint value creation.\n\n",

This echoes similar findings in other research focused on uptake of SRHR research in policy-making. \n\nThe importance of identifying opportunities and strategic phases in the research and policy cycle where uptake of evidence could be maximised through dialogue with stakeholders is supported by evidence from the case studies discussed in the research in Ghana, Belgium and Kenya, as well as by other research done in the Netherlands among stakeholders working in international development and SRHR. \n\nThe workshop identified key strategies for translating research into policy, including joint agenda-setting\nbetween researchers and policy-makers, as well as building trust and partnerships with different stakeholders. These were linked to stages within Hanney et al.’s framework as opportunities for engaging with policy-makers to ensure uptake of research findings. Joint agenda-setting has been mentioned as an important approach for advocating the prioritisation of specific SRHR issues and an opportunity for policy framing, especially in low- and middle-income contexts.\n\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "-Trust building is critical for translating research into policy or practice. However, trust building takes substantial but worthwhile time and resource investment. Building trust and fostering partnerships with policy-makers, service providers and other stakeholders should be a continuous process and not only at the point of research dissemination.\n\n-Informal meetings provide an opportunity for researchers to network with stakeholders like policymakers.\nThere are many advantages gained from building trust and fostering partnerships between researchers and other stakeholders. These include, but are not limited to, increased uptake of research findings by different stakeholders.\n\n-Researchers should engage with the media to ensure public dissemination of key research findings and emphasise key SRHR issues.\n\n-Researchers should identify ‘knowledge gaps’ for policy-making and target their research to address these. Opportunities exist to develop an accountability framework between researchers and policymakers.\nThis can help in ensuring that health policies developed are evidence based and effective in addressing the most relevant problems and the most vulnerable populations. \n",

      "Document Title": "Linked Boundary Functions: Examining the Role of ‘Research for Development’ Organizations in Integrating Levels of Resource Governance",
      "Key Findings": "Our findings showed that the facilitative activities and partnership approach of ACIAR\nFisheries Program staff marked the agency as a boundary-spanning actor in the Solomon Islands, placing the agency as an influencer, through program staff activities, rather than as a passive funds provider. As such, ACIAR’s approach is consistent with the turn toward ‘research for’ or ‘research in’ development by research brokers. We also established that ACIAR had invested resources and energy into the development of partnerships with other R4D agencies as a complement to its partnership approach with the Solomon Islands Government.\n\t\nViewed through the lens of linked boundary functions, the boundary work of each agency, ACIAR, and WorldFish, were necessary conditions, but neither alone were sufficient conditions, for the integration of the top-down and bottom-up approaches. Further, the strong partnership approach between ACIAR and WorldFish ensured this integration was meaningful and accessible to both local communities and Government agencies. The lens of boundary theory suggested that ACIAR’s distinct ongoing facilitative activities as part of the boundary chain were likely to have been important.\n\nACIAR’s partnership with the Solomon Islands Government was a necessarily supportive condition for top-down attentiveness to local solutions but was not, in itself, sufficient for generating the substantive credible and salient bottom-up content.\n\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "Resource governance in the Solomon Islands is complex and carries a real risk of disconnect between national and provincial government and local communities. This paper has contributed to understanding how R4D organizations as boundary spanners can effectively negotiate this complexity by increasing the awareness of their linked boundary functions. The probe has established that boundary chain theory has significant explanatory power for better understanding the R4D context. Our findings do suggest, that the boundary chain concept provides complexity-awareness. \n\nBy bringing together the insights from the R4D literature and the linked boundary function theory, this article contributes to the current discussion of “complexity-aware” theory of change in natural resource governance. Our findings, therefore, suggest that linked boundary function theory is likely to be a useful avenue for empirical research. Such research would further our understanding of how integrated resource governance can be progressed given the complexity of the research for the development environment\n",

      "Document Title": "Rethinking Research Partnerships: Evidence and Politics of participation in research partnerships for International Development ",
      "Key Findings": "Institutions:  Partnerships are situated within complex institutional structures, spanning multiple geographical locations and often incorporating other stakeholder organizations in other locations. There is relationship between these different spaces is distributed by organizational structures and processes and also by other factors such as funding conditions and, more broadly, by geo-politic.\n\nPractices: The types of approach and relationships that are valued in partnerships are determined by factors including research cultures, intellectual histories and ways of working within different sectors of practice. This includes timeframes, both in terms of the duration of funded projects and the pace and rhythms of working.\n\nIdentities:  Personal research biographies are informed by different contexts through formal roles and job descriptions and informal experiences and sense of self. Different subjectivities are granted different status in different cultural contexts, distributed, for example, along lines of age, gender, sexuality, ethnicity, language, nationality, (dis)ability and socio-economic background.\n\nArtefacts: Material environments (including the layout and content of buildings and virtual spaces) as well as\nObjects and infrastructure can have a symbolic and instrumental influence on what counts as valid evidence and who can access and contribute to existing sources of evidence.\n\nAccounts: The idea of what constitutes a valid research partnership is rooted in social discourses that evolve through and across institutional and disciplinary narratives in interaction with social practices and global events. These include trends around, for example, ‘impact’, ‘public engagement’, ‘official development assistance-compliance’ and ‘capacity building’ and contribute to the ways in which partnerships are configured, the value given\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "First, evidence is never neutral. What counts as legitimate evidence is shaped by the institutional contexts that frame partnerships; funding protocols; systems of career progression; research approaches, tools and infrastructures; and language use. \n\nSecond, the ways that evidence is valued in partnerships have implications for participation, determining whose expertise counts and to what extent. This can have a detrimental effect on research that aims to be actionable. \n\nThird, research is seldom a straight forward linear process. The messiness of personal circumstance, social relations,\nconflicting agendas, institutional restructuring and unanticipated geopolitical events is compounded when the goals of producing knowledge and informing action are brought together. \n\nFourth, the spatial dimension of partnerships should also be recognized. There is a tendency in social science research to consider only the empirical context of ‘implementation’ without adequately acknowledging the ‘home’ context of the research institution and funders. It is important to recognize that while all research partnerships are grounded in specific contexts, they also have the potential to transform and create new contexts.\n\nFifth, research partnerships have the power to affect transformation. This may be internal to the partnership; external in the short term; and external in the longer term (through the rocky road to impact from access of outputs to uptake, adaptation and use) and through changes in discourse around the meaning of evidence and partnerships.\n\nSixth, learning is key for productive partnerships. As well as developing traditional academic skills/knowledge, the series also identified other types of ‘research engagement literacies’.\n",

      "Document Title": "Building Collaborative Youth Development research-practice partnerships through cooperative extension",
      "Key Findings": "Recent interest in community-engaged research and teaching among both universities and funding agencies offers an opportunity for responsibly-conducted applied research that integrates the knowledge of practitioners, asks practice-informed questions, prepares students, and maintains successful partnerships.  Youth development researchers are well-poised to forge collaborations with communities, as understanding and supporting children’s development is a common interest all communities share. Yet, both researcher and practitioner partners should be prepared to encounter challenges. \n\nSuccessful partnerships can advance our understanding of youth development and help us improve the lives of youth, who stand to benefit from a nationwide Cooperative Extension network that can help spread good developmental practices to children and families\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "Formal infrastructures like the PRYDE initiative can help guide successful partnerships and assist partners in navigating the barriers at the institution and community levels that can make collaboration challenging.   Similar programs such as PROSPER—which links Cooperative Extension networks across both Iowa State University and Pennsylvania State University—report positive effects on community members' views of Cooperative Extension programming. However, not all researchers and practitioners have access to intermediary organizations like PRYDE or PROSPER or even to the Cooperative Extension network.\nIn the absence of these formal supports, we expect that there is an even greater imperative to discuss and clarify the distinct language, values, and motivations that researchers and practitioners bring to a collaboration. Establishing the motivations and expectations of both partners is a useful trust-building exercise, not just at the outset of a project but through ongoing reflection on the partnership process itself. In our experience, the keys to success are to seek partnerships that incorporate practitioner insights early and extend over time. In particular, our advice emphasizes ways that researchers can meet practitioners in the applied settings and conferences in which they work, and together design studies that fit within the paradigms that exist in their youth programs. We also underscore the benefits of creating opportunities for youth to be meaningfully involved in these research collaborations. Readied with our advice for initiating successful collaboration, we encourage readers to identify their state Cooperative Extension network—or seek out youth-serving organizations in their community—and explore new partnerships.\n\n\n\n\n",

      "Key Findings": "The challenges facing the world today are complex, and no single organization or sector can hope to effectively confront these issues alone. Not only is partnership increasingly seen as a multi-stakeholder phenomenon rather than a bilateral one, but there also is a discernible move towards a network framing (e.g., as “innovation systems” or “boundary spanning”). This change is driven by the progressive inclusion of agricultural research goals as part of the wider development agenda, where complexity and systemic change are central. In turn, this requires more appropriate strategies for knowledge creation, innovation, and partnership. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "No particular disciplinary credential (whether breeding, economics, agronomy, etc.) alone signals the necessary skills and capabilities to understand and assess agri-food systems as complex, coupled systems involving ecological and economic phenomena and indeed requiring understanding of interactions across these coupled systems. Scientific leadership for agri-food systems programs depends primarily on capacity for systems thinking, embodying competencies in “the analysis of complex systems, integrating societal, environmental and economic perspectives … understanding of complexity, holistic approaches, and how the parts relate to the whole,” which can be learned through formal study beyond conventional academic disciplines and also can be developed through training and experience.",

      "Key Findings": "Understanding the wider system in which AR4D takes place, and the ability to ensure the continuous improvement of innovation and partnership practice at different operational and governance\nlevels, is central to contributions of AR4D to the SDGs, such as the elimination of poverty (SDG 1).\n-Linking local to regional and global scales is key to achieving impacts at scales sufficient to induce the transformative changes required to achieve the SDGs, including SDG 1. This will require explicit efforts to find ways to articulate action and agendas among MSPs at different scales, rather than establishing new parallel and competing arrangements. Critical to this will be the ability of AR4D organisations and others to identify existing architectures or backbone structures and to contribute to these constructively in supporting or leading roles.\n\n-The subsidiarity principle is key to the effective operation of these multi-scale operations. MSPs are intended to be less like multi-scale bureaucracies and more like clubs or communities of practice. This is important as it allows such initiatives to act as a genuine platform, empowering a variety of stakeholders to engage as and when appropriate and in ways amenable to different types of actors.\n-Stakeholders and platforms at different system levels have comparative advantages at certain levels.\n\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "Taken together, the papers in this special issue point to an urgent need for a practical, conceptually-coherent delineation of what constitutes an “agri-food systems perspective” within AR4D programs.\nAlthough such an operational definition is beyond the scope of this SI, we do believe that the papers in this SI suggest some necessary attributes for any claim to an “agri-food systems perspective.”\nSecondly, there is need for program design based on integrative systems thinking, taking a comprehensive view of the agri-food systems, both within major programs and across the portfolio of international AR4D efforts. Prioritization both across agri-food systems and within agri-food systems programs reflects systems thinking and analysis. From an agri-food systems perspective, program priorities would be derived from integrated assessment of societal, environmental, and economic aspects of the agri-food system, including strategic ex ante assessment of leverage points based on informed, contextualized analysis of how major parts relate to the whole agri-food system.\nPartnership is increasingly seen as a multi-stakeholder process rather than a bilateral one, and there is a discernible move towards the “systems” framing of the rationale driven by the progressive alignment of agricultural research goals with the wider development agenda.\n\nFinally, national government interests and research capacities need to be more systematically enhanced as a fundamental pillar of multi-stakeholder partnerships.\n",

      "Key Findings": "The interaction between FoodSTART and investment projects in the initial meetings and during the stage of coordination for scoping studies allowed to understand better “the regime”. In particular it became apparent that investment projects were embedded within national and provincial public sector hierarchies implying that decisions and agreements about the collaboration, especially investment project staff support for the scoping studies, were often made by higher level managers organizationally and geographically remote from the project sites and often from the discourse about RTCs and FBSs.\n\nSecondly, a deepening of the partnership towards the stage of co-operation occurred through the development of joint work plans, with identification of key activities, assignment of responsibilities and identification of financial or in-kind contributions. The variation across the partnerships in the degree of work plan implementation and sharing of resources was due to different factors.\n\nFinally, workshop evaluation feedback from participants revealed that two types of learning process occurred among investment\nproject personnel. First, the initial FBS orientation workshops involved participation from a wide range of staff, from senior managers to field staff in all locations. The participation of senior managers facilitated institutional support for the innovation incubation process. Indication that the managers in four of the investment projects had recognized the opportunity offered by FBS was a first critical step for subsequent scaling in these partnerships. Managers appreciated and took advantage of the FBS potential for spill-over across multiple commodities. \n\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "The recognized stages through which most partnerships pass provides a useful framework for analyzing the dynamics and drivers   of these partnerships. These drivers include a conducive external environment, good fit between what was offered and demanded by partners, reasonable alignment in the timing of the partners' intervention, excellent partnering of the individuals involved in the partnerships, their limited turnover and sufficient ability to make decisions related to collaborative activities. While this list is unlikely to be comprehensive, recognizing these drivers, or the lack of, and the way they are intertwined can greatly enhance the likelihood of establishing and maintaining effective partnership for scaling innovation.

      "Key Findings": "Our results suggest that volatility in investment does not have a negative effect on aid effectiveness. We find, paradoxically, that DRG is more effective at greater levels of volatility, but the implications of this finding are far from clear. When we split the sample, cases with low volatility display lower returns on DRG investment as volatility rises, but cases with high volatility display better returns on DRG as volatility increases. \n\nBecause greater volatility is related to positive surges in levels of investment, it is possible that volatility in investment has a non-linear moderating effect, such that DRG investment is more effective when investments are very stable (because programs are steady), and when investments are fluctuating considerably (because investment is surging). Although plausible, this interpretation requires a more careful exploration in the future.\nLastly, we documented that the contribution of DRG assistance depends on factors well beyond the donor’s control. DRG programs have more consistent effects on electoral autocracies, but their effects decline when recipients are already experiencing a process of democratic backsliding. In a context of autocratization, democracy assistance is bound to contain losses rather than to prompt gains in democratization\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "The findings suggest that the international context has become more adverse to democratization, imposing greater challenges to DRG programs worldwide. In the 1990s, with the momentum created by the third wave of democratization, global trends facilitated (and were reinforced by) DRG investments. After 2001, US programs expanded considerably, but operated in the context of new priorities and tradeoffs in the wake of 9/11. The expansion of Chinese economic influence, Russia’s global power, and authoritarian “gravity centers” at the regional level have potentially undermined the effectiveness of US DRG in the contemporary era.",

      "Key Findings": "-Success in removing structural barriers to the innovation process, including amended rules and regulations and the provision of market incentives. Regulatory changes have emerged in the areas of bioenergy, heating, electricity, driving and smart grids, solar PV, and biofuels.\n\n-Knowledge sharing and cooperation. The Green Deals have generated added value for participants by stimulating agreements on knowledge-sharing, cooperation, and networking, as well as taking concrete steps toward trialing and piloting projects.\nThey have also added significant value in disseminating expertise, experience, and best practices, which has led to the emergence of communities of practice or living labs.\n\n-Awareness and political buy-in. The Green Deals have contributed to sustainability and green growth by placing key topics on the agenda in various domains of society and at various levels of government, which has created greater awareness and political buy-in.\n\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "1.Testbeds may be more feasible to implement than sandboxes.\nThe rigidities imposed by the LAC legal system, which follows the civil law tradition and emphasizes the systematic codification of the general law, mean, in some cases, having to seek parliamentary approval to be able to offer regulatory wavers. \n\nTaking the issue of legal rigidities into account, Argentina and Uruguay are discussing the possibility of drafting ‘blanket regulations’ to enable the creation of sectoral sandboxes.\nOther countries should consider revising their regulatory frameworks to facilitate the implementation of experimental schemes.\n2. The international examples show that both approaches are implemented, in practice, in variety of ways and include a series of complementary supports.\nThey act as one-stop shops for information and advice on existing regulation, provide temporary exemptions, offer funding for (collaborative) research and innovation projects, provide access to testing facilities, and promote networking and knowledge sharing.\n\n3. The multi-sectoral nature of some innovations requires coordinated action by actors and regulators.\nThis may call for a multi-sectoral governance mechanisms and/or the leadership of an organization with a supra-national mandate. \n\n4. Regulators should remain neutral, at arms’ length from the private sector.\nRegulatory sandboxes could, for example, work with licensing companies only, or with approved technologies that need further adaptation and enhancement to operate in real settings (as in the NHS program). \n\n5. Innovation agencies are key players in the innovation ecosystem, with good knowledge of innovators and innovation processes, which tend to be perceived as neutral agents (with an independent role). \n\n\n",

      "Key Findings": "Scaling of innovations is the outcome of complex dynamics in innovation and livelihood systems and scaling strategies need to recognize the characteristics of complex systems dynamics. To connect the science and the practice of scaling, there is a need to develop complexity-aware models that can guide operational and strategic decision-making on scaling of innovation in R4D. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "One of the aims of scaling readiness is to assists R4D interventions in developing, implementing and monitoring scaling strategies in a structured way. The following is an iterative cycle of five steps that builds on key concepts, measures and requirements. \nStep 1: Characterize the innovation system in the spatial and temporal context in which scaling is to deliver impact.\nStep 2: Diagnosis that supports independent and evidence based assessment of the individual innovations in the package in terms of their innovation readiness and innovation use. This step subsequently helps to identify bottleneck innovations that keep the innovation package from contributing to the defined goals and impact in a particular context. \nStep 3: Strategize - The diagnosis of the innovation package and the identification of scaling bottlenecks is meant to kick-start a process of scaling strategy development.\n\nStep 4: Agree on the feasibility and acceptability of the scaling strategy.\n\nStep 5:  If agreement is reached on a scaling strategy and a scaling action plan, the implementation and monitoring of the agreed-upon activities begins.\n\nFinally, scaling readiness can support the management of R4D portfolios and investments. Many organizations involved in the R4D sector manage not just one, but multiple R4D interventions as part of their portfolio. With increasing pressure to show returns on investment and impact at scale these R4D organizations can use the key concepts and measures of Scaling Readiness to monitor and manage their R4D portfolio and guide investments to increase the overall scaling readiness of their innovation portfolio. \n",

While citation rates are dependent on many variables and generally get larger over time, the fact that 43% of CCR publications emerging in FY18 have already been cited by other researchers is another sign of the recognition CCR research is receiving.\n\nTarget 3: elevating the research infrastructure and culture of Indonesian HEIs.\nCCR Reports uniformly state that the research environment at participating HEIs has changed as a result of the trainings, guidance, and modeling they encountered on best practices in managing and supporting research.\n\nTarget 4: providing on-going professional development and hands-on research opportunities for faculty, students, and postdoctoral researchers.\nReports mention the value Indonesian scholars derived from the SHERA training sessions they attended and from their interactions with U.S. scholars, both face-to-face and virtually. These activities elevated the way Indonesian scholars thought about their research while also entering them into global research conversations.\n\nTarget 5: building the collaborative linkages among HEIs needed for high-level, multi-faceted research, both within and beyond Indonesia.\nU.S. scholars made 43 visits to their partner CCRs, giving training sessions, mentoring Indonesian researchers, and joining in research projects. \n",

In addition, key learnings from PRSSP’s Transfer Modality Research Initiative (TMRI) were incorporated in Bangladesh’s National Plan of Action for Nutrition (NPAN) and seventh Five Year Plan. Specifically, PRSSP was a contributor to a causal package that was likely sufficient to produce the 2015 NNP. \n-PRSSP did not play a major role in CIP-2 but contributed mostly through its research, stakeholder consultations, and inputs on plan content. PRSSP research informed plan content on nutrition, food supply chains, and food systems. In addition, PRSSP research and inputs, particularly ANGeL and TMRI, highlighted the necessity of creating synergy between the three pillars of food security.\n-PRSSP contributed to putting nutrition on the agricultural and food security policy agenda as reflected by an increased focus on nutrition in the 2015 NNP and the incorporation of six recommendations reflecting the nexus between nutrition and the three pillars of food security in the 2018 NAP. PRSSP was a contributor to and a likely necessary component of a causal package that was likely sufficient to integrate nutrition and its nexus with the three pillars of food security into policy and programming.\n-Informal interactions between PRSSP and local stakeholders contributed to local capacity building as did local stakeholder collaboration with PRSSP on research design and implementation. \n\n\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "Develop a sustainability plan for the APSU and provide it bridge funding until it can transition to a more stable source of financing, likely some combination of GOB and external funding. The sustainability plan should include, a timeframe for the approval of a revised organogram, staff recruitment rules, short and long-term funding strategy. \n2. In the process of securing staff and funding for the APSU, incorporate conditions in any agreement with the GOB that provides guarantees for staff stability to minimize rotation in and out of the unit. \n3. For any follow-up activity, include a wider diversity of national policy actors, including an expanded set of GOB ministries; mid-level and field-level policy actors and implementers; CGIAR members; National Agricultural Research System (NARS) institutions; BARC; National Nutrition Council. \n4. For any follow-up activity, expand policy research and analysis activities to a larger number of sectors and policy areas, including fisheries and livestock, with an emphasis on aligning research activities with USAID/Bangladesh’s FTF activity portfolio. \n5. For any follow-on activity, structure the contract to facilitate greater coordination between the implementer and the Mission FTF activity portfolio to ensure that research and policy analysis address identified policy constraints facing the Mission’s FTF activities. \n6. Develop a BIHS sustainability plan that includes funding and human resources to ensure its maintenance, provide limited capacity assistance for those using the dataset, and update it periodically This may involve formally handing the dataset over to another national entity, such as the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS). \n\n",

The qualitative research team found effects of the program on policy and programming, academic output, production of academic output, and career advancement of both researchers and students. Analysis of the quantitative data did not produce such results. \n-PEER grantees are 10 percent more likely to have received a promotion, an increase in salary, or an additional paid or advisory role compared to PEER applicants that did not receive funding. This result could reveal an element of prestige and respect gained by PEER researchers. PEER researchers have the ability to purchase high-quality equipment, bring in funding from the United States, and collaborate with U.S. government-funded researchers to produce high-quality output. \n\t\n-There is, however, a negative relationship between participation in the PEER program and the production of technology or patents. This could be due to the focus of the research selection process on development and policy-related issues. In addition, the focus of the PEER program activities may have prioritized policy-related output over technology or patent production. \n\n-Our inability to detect an effect in the quantitative analysis on the other indicators including academic output, policy impact, receiving additional funding, or other capacity building outcomes could imply that there is truly no effect of the program on these indicators. Another explanation is that there is a true effect but that we do not have sufficient statistical power to detect it. We explore both possible explanations in the conclusions section.\n\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "•Support principal investigators (PIs) to form policy suggestions that would have a greater success of uptake. This could include advocating policy suggestions on behalf of the PI or providing training to PI’s on how to translate scientific data into policy briefs. \n•. A USAID or government collaborator could participate in the proposal and research design to ensure there is overlap between relevant data and development goals within the country to create effective policy and programming, or to message evidence for policy and programming more effectively to local stakeholders.\n•Base PEER calls for proposals on USAID’s Country Development Cooperation Strategy (CDCS) for the country to increase research utility.\n•For research projects with the highest policy relevance, work with host governments and, if funding is available, leverage government research dollars for PIs to sustain or build upon their research post-PEER. \n•Support governments in their capacity to analyze data in order to create effective evidence-based policy. \n•Create a research database hosted by Missions that would include a contact directory where other researchers could find out what work was done within their specific field. \nRevise the PEER Program Theory of Change to more fully integrate the role that policy-makers play in achieving the program goal of improved development outcomes through their need for, access to, and utilization of research outputs. \n•Refine outcome variables for future evaluations. This evaluation included a large number of dependent variables, some were not necessarily aligned with PEER programming. \n •Revisit a PEER evaluation after all cycles are complete.\n \n\n",

      "Key Findings": "\tThe Free Trade Zone with its industrial park and the monopolistic form of capitalism which its new industries enjoin have generated considerable employment in Manaus. By some estimates, more than 40,000 new jobs have been created in the Industrial Park alone. This has attracted large numbers of immigrants to Manaus, particularly from the interior of Amazonas. \nIn view of this data, workers in the informal sector as compared to white collar workers and workers in the new industrial sector, are overwhelmingly migrants. However, contrary to what might be expected these workers are not disproportionately recent migrants. They are migrants who arrived in Manaus some years before the creation of the new industrial economy. \nClearly, there seems to be a significant relationship between household structure and economy and work in the formal and informal sectors. \nWorkers in the informal sector, like those employed in the more traditional wood processing industry, tend to be heads of households. Almost 70% of the households included in the study engaged a multiple income strategy in that they contained two or more economically active persons. \n\nThis data seems to lend support to those theorists who have argued that that the formal/informal dichotomy, unless carefully used, tends to obscure the systemic structural features of developmental change. \n \n",
      "Key Recommendations": "It should be noted that the findings reported in this study are not entirely consistent with those reported by other observers for various countries of Latin America. Thus from a comparative point of view, these findings pose questions that are not easily resolved. It is entirely possible that these findings are peculiar to the Free Trade Zone. \n\nAlternatively, given the role of the state in the relationship to labor organizations and the provision of medical and other services, the informal sector in various Brazilian cities may have acquired characteristics somewhat different from those reported for other Latin American countries. Clearly more comparative data are needed to resolve many of the issues posed by discussions of this subject.  \n",

They will tend to specialize in raising large or small animals or growing crops--- but will not as a whole combine any of these three alternatives. \nKey finding from this study is:\n-\tFirst, decision about adopting new agricultural technologies seem to be determined by both economic and socio-cultural variables. Often because of too much emphasis on narrow expertise in most studies of projects, there is tendency to concentrate on one set of variables at the expense of others. \n-\tSecondly, contrary to the hypothesis that most farmers are totally dominated by their socio-cultural values, it is in fact economic concerns which emerge as the most important determinants of the decisions of the local clients.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "This study makes a strong case against the false picture of the farmer as mistrusting the stranger, resisting change and thus failing to take advantage of the economic opportunities offered. Local farmers usually turn out to have sound economic reasons for adopting or rejecting proposed innovations. Consequently, in cases of project failure the emphasis should not be put on blaming local clients, but on the need for serious technical and economic studies of the proposed innovations in the proper context.

      "Key Findings": "1. The project is a success and will achieve its original purpose and outputs by the PACD. \nThis finding is based on the limited objectives of the original project. It is not a finding based on current AID criteria for ASEAN or other project activities. \n2. The research conducted did not fit current AID criteria for relevance to an area of AID interest. \nThis finding does not imply that the research done was not generally relevant to development. However, AID has found that best results are obtained by concentrating its resources on a few areas determined in strategy statements to be of AID interest. ISEAS also found it difficult to administer a broad variety of research topics. \nAID also wants research it sponsors applied in a reasonable time to development problems. ISEAS is capable of influencing key policy-makers and others affecting development, but could not have had much impact in this area with the diverse research activities under this project. \n3. Training benefits of the project meet the objective of strengthening ASEAN capacities, but were not focused on identified ASEAN needs. This finding is another reflection of the difference between early ASEAN projects and current AID practice. There was no analysis to show need for the training received. \n4. Project costs were only slightly less on a per trainee basis than training in the U.S. \nThe $21,700 per fellowship cost would not be excessive for post-doctoral work of about a year in the U.S., but it is not much lower. \n\n\n\n\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "\n-All concerned in the project --ISEAS management, fellows, and AID project managers --are to be commended on its success.  However, before considering requests for follow-on assistance for ISEAS research, AID and ISEAS should find ways to bring the activity into line with current AID research criteria. \n-AID should not support further research in a number of fields of unknown relation to AID strategy. Any follow-on research activity should be based on a topic of AID relevance such as small business development. \n-No future project should be considered as a training activity unless the need for the training is established and the project is focused on that need. \n-Future ASEAN training activities should be closely examined to determine the extent of cost savings over U.S. training.   \n",

This has led to current breeding objectives to produce an improved local photosensitive sorghum with tan plant color specifically for use in value added processing. A product of this research is a new sorghum product called SORI which was developed in Mali. The process is similar to rice parboiling. Partially cooked, steeped sorghum was dried and decorticated to produce endosperm pieces that can be cooked like rice. \n\nSoil Management CRSP programs have identified readily available plant species that are well suited to low-input sustainable land-management systems.\nPastures based on acid-tolerant legumes and compatible grasses increase per unit.  cattle-production area in the humid tropics, thus raising income and food quality while reducing the need to destroy more rain forests.\n",

      "Key Findings": "The Ethiopian Institute of Agricultural Research (EIAR) has in recent years introduced a shift in agricultural research for development, which is based on the innovation systems approach that involved cultivating partnerships with several actors along the value chain, especially farmers, farmers’ cooperatives, and input suppliers. Compared to the three-year baseline average (2003–05), crop output increased nationally by 89%, 85%, and 97% in 2008 for common bean, chickpea, and lentil respectively. Nationally, 53–59% of the output growth is attributable to yield growth due to technological change, while the\nbalance is due to area expansion. These results affirm that the new approach has led to accelerated adoption of new and high-yielding or low-risk varieties.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Often the ingredients for a successful scaling up and/or research-into-use process are within the system, but do not work as a system. Therefore, it is frequently not so much technology failure that inhibits uptake as a failure of the institutions and actors to make the system work as a system. A catalytic effect is required to create that coherence and integration and the commitment of the actors to drive the process from inside and make it work. The facilitation of this process is critical and the skills and attitudes to do it successfully are vital for such initiatives. The right leadership is needed, as are other key ingredients such as markets and technologies – and all are needed at the right time.",

Randomization for impact evaluation is also hard to implement. There are no baseline surveys or they have been poorly designed for impact evaluation. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "Well-designed and well-funded impact evaluations should be carried out from the beginning. Control and treatment groups should be designated before a project's implementation and tracked. Baseline and post-project surveys should be conducted.",

Ethical concerns about the impact evaluations of humanitarian assisstance are valid and can be addressed, making impact evaluations feasible from an ethical point of view.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Given the sudden onset or slow onset nature of emergencies, national actors and international donors can prepare on three fronts: learning about where emergencies may unfold and asisstance may be needed, plan ahead and be prepared to intervene when one unfolds and they can prepare their impact evaluaiton designs in advance, drawing on the many insights on conducting successful impact evaluations offered in this paper.",

The Vietnamese government should allocate more research funding and confer a higher level of autonomy to universities.",

      "Key Findings": "While Rwanda has the largest and strongest potato research program in the region,  Zaire's program lacks local funding, Burundi has to depend on the expatriate International Potato Center (CIP) advisors, and in Uganda just establish the program and has so many limitations.  Potato research programs have made some progress in the following areas: developing improved potatoes varieties that are resistant to Late Blight and Bacterial WIlt, rapid seed multiplication techniques, clean seed production, seed storage on-station and on-farm, integrated pest management, use of repellant plants in stores, and dormancy breaking.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "In order to make effective networking investments, there is a need for more bilateral training and local cost support. PRAPAC needs to focus on improving linkages between potato research and the agencies overseeing seed bulking and distribution.  An assessment is needed to understand the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of alternative ways of funding central African potato research, studies, and training. Also,  the collection and monitoring of socio-economic baseline data should be prioritized.",

Improved germplasms should be tested for adaptability and performance under the current and/or modified cropping systems. The economist should involve in training national program scientists to incorporate economic and cost-benefit analyses. Fertilizers and seed dressing trials should be conducted on-farm trials using manure/compost. Before making any research recommendation, researchers should try to get a better understanding of farmer practices.\nResearchers involved in technology transfer should expand their support for training in farmer-participation methods of on-farm research.",

Having tracked the numerous and rapid changes of the intervening\ndecade, it is, therefore, entirely fitting that the UNESCO Forum should take stock of the new\ndynamics in 2009, when UNESCO will reprise these major conferences so as to chart progress\nand identify emerging trends",
      "Key Recommendations": "The author focuses on the question of whether\nand how the work of the Forum helped to advance beyond received thinking and current policy\n“commonsense” the relationship between knowledge systems and socio-economic development,\naccounting seriously for context in relation to low-income and middle-income countries while\nalso operating within a globalized knowledge society and innovation discourse.",

Some of\nthe main results of this university–community partnership were its contribution to sustainability,\nincluding the activation of local capabilities and networking across various local stakeholder groups\nthrough various small-scale projects and the co-production of a socially grounded and landscape-based\nrural development plan for the micro-region.\"\n",

For this characteristic, participatory action\nresearch is naturally apt to support RSIs in crossing and bridging\ndiverse disciplines and different forms of knowledge. This is, again,\na key point in the sustainability debate.\"\n",

      "Key Findings": " The key findings were as follows: There was a lack of clarity and agreement (pact) about a development model and the role of higher education in development, at both national and university levels. There was, however, an increasing awareness, particularly at government level, of the importance of universities in the global context of the knowledge economy. Research production at the eight African universities was not strong enough to enable them to build on their traditional undergraduate teaching roles and make a sustainable, comprehensive contribution to development via new knowledge production. A number of universities had manageable student–staff ratios and adequately qualified staff, but inadequate funds for staff to engage in research. In addition, the incentive regimes did not support knowledge production. In none of the countries in the sample was there a coordinated effort between government, external stakeholders and the university to systematically strengthen the contribution that the university can make to development. While at each of the universities there were exemplary development projects that connected strongly to external stakeholders and strengthened the academic core, the challenge is how to increase the number of these projects.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "\"For African countries to move from being providers of raw materials and receivers of foreign\naid to the next stages of development that will make them part of the global knowledge\neconomy, implies at least the following. Firstly, agreement (a pact) about the importance\nof knowledge in development and the special role of the university. Secondly, strengthening\nthe academic core, particularly in terms of knowledge production. Thirdly, greater\ncoordination amongst an increasing number of actors and agencies (multiple government\ndepartments, business and foreign donors) involved in higher education. And finally,\nensuring that development activities strengthen rather than weaken academic capacity,\nparticularly for flagship universities.\"\n",

      "Document Title": "Evaluation of LAC Higher Education Scholarships Program",
      "Key Findings": "The principle findings contain two types, one is the value of the investment and the other is the recipient outcomes. For the former, the examination of the value of USAID’s investment in the CASS and SEED programs looked at resource efficiencies and effectiveness of implementation of the studied programs as conceived. Factors such as recruitment and selection of CASS/SEED scholars while ensuring recipients were supported in meeting their own objectives, as well as those of the program. CASS/SEED cost-share requirements for subcontractors are higher than average. However, CASS/SEED as it is currently structured is weak in its follow-up and support of recipients after they return home. As for the latter, the examination of the role of scholarship recipients as change agents was organized around the objectives of the program in terms of employment, leadership development, community participation and international involvement.",
      "Key Recommendations": "USAID should work on the following six topics to further the initial gains of the LAC program and increase understanding on the program’s overall impact. First, an in-depth study to examining why there appears to be a relative lack of program impact on recipient community involvement. Second should be an examination of the elements of the teacher professional development program that have encouraged teachers to continue to work in rural areas after training. Third, a continuation and increase on emphasizing computer training and use, which can facilitate international communication as a strategy to achieve global market participation. Fourth, USAID and SEED should consider addressing the potential of the non-recipient finalists, who generally have all of the capacity that the scholars have, but are left behind with no further support or input. A low-cost program involving a “buddy system,” in which a non-recipient works with a recipient on implementing an action plan or a class project, might be a low-cost option to be tested on a trial basis. Fifth, strategies used by other scholarship programs to broaden impact might be considered, given the evolution of resources in the region. Sixth, consistent with USAID’s education policy, future work should consider whether investing in secondary school completion for disadvantaged youth similar to those who had access to CASS/SEED. ",

Although investigation of these questions was largely\nbeyond the remit of this review, our findings can provide some important insights for\npolicy-makers engaged in decision-making around these issues. First, there continues to be significant interest in the long-standing debate around the\nrelative importance of investment in different levels of education. Second, there is substantial debate around which types of TE provision, and which\ninterventions, are likely to have the greatest development impact.\"\n",

In addition to the general need for more research considering the impact of TE on development, we suggest the following as the most\ncritical research needs within this domain: Further macro-level studies, using updated datasets and acknowledging time lag of\nImpact, Research gauging the non-market benefits of TE, Further analysis of the link between TE and poverty reduction, Further assessment of the impact of the research and service functions of TEIs, as well as investigation of how the three pillars interact to impact development, Studies following the process from inputs all the way to impact, Investigation of how limiting factors in particular contexts affect impact, Research into the effectiveness (and cost-effectiveness) of varying models of external support to TE\n\"\n",

A framework is proposed structured around three\nkey dimensions: first, ‘value’—the extent to which knowledge is treated as intrinsically or\ninstrumentally worthwhile; second, ‘function’—the role of the university in terms of storage,\ntransmission, production or application of knowledge; third, ‘interaction’—the flow of ideas\nand actors between the university and society\"\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "\" The university that will address the post-2015 development agenda may not need to be a\nstate university, at least not in the traditional sense of a fully state-controlled and taxfunded\ninstitution. Yet it will need to be a public institution, that is to say, one fully\noriented towards the public good.

      "Key Findings": "LEAD alumni are most likely to assume positions of leadership in the private sector in Cairo/Giza and abroad, and less likely to assume positions in the government or in their home governorates. Alumni were still only minimally satisfied with LEAD-managed compared to AUC-managed activities/services. In particular, a missed opportunity for LEAD to provide a better experience for students in two key areas: orientation and student life coordinators. Moreover, Females’ achievements in terms of GPA, LPI scores, and completion rates in the LEAD program were greater than males, with no apparent advantages given to them from LEAD or AUC. Investments in LEAD are worthwhile from a social point of view, given that the IRR is double the social discount rate. Such investments in higher education at other universities would yield a higher IRR, but not necessarily the same employment results regarding employer satisfaction with LEAD alumni’s English, leadership skills, and other soft skills. The AUC has the institutional capacity and commitment to sustain a LEAD-type scholarship program. If donors wish to fund liberal arts education at a top-ranked university, AUC is currently the only option in Egypt. While AUC has limited internal funds for assisting disadvantaged students, they have the capacity to attract external funding for LEAD-type scholarship programs, though perhaps not at the same scale as LEAD.",
      "Key Recommendations": " If USAID prioritizes development of potential leaders in the private sector in Egypt and abroad, future program design may want to consider funding scholarships at universities, such as AUC, where students graduate with strong English language and soft skills that are valued in the private sector. Additionally, future program design may consider funding scholarship programs that keep students connected to Egypt and their communities. In addition to program goals, to achieve greater satisfaction from an AUC scholarship program at a reduced cost, future higher education scholarship initiative designs should consider the following: Full tuition, living allowances, etc., funding for English language training, increasing student life coordinators caseloads, using peer mentors, job training, an orientation program addressing challenges as highlighting opportunities, and a monitoring and evaluation systems (including using student feedback). To achieve gender balance in terms of program outcomes, male students should be monitored to ensure they continue their studies through graduation. If USAID’s concern is a higher return on its investments, restricting its financing to focus on Engineering and Business as opposed to the Humanities and Social Sciences is an option. However, USAID should not be dissuaded from investing in AUC given that the internal rates of return across all programs of study exist. Given that AUC has the commitment, institutional capacity, and potential resources to sustain funding for disadvantaged students, consideration should be given to the extent to which additional funding to AUC is advantageous in advancing USAID/Egypt’s long-term strategy.",

The main objective of this EGM was to catalogue the current evidence base around how STIP is used to enhance development programming in L&MICs. The clearest finding from this study is that although a large number of studies are included in the map, they are generally clustered in a few key areas, leaving gaps in large portions of the map. We identify a number of patterns in the evidence: a large number of impact evaluations that evaluate m-health interventions, Outcomes are most commonly measured at the individual or household levels of analysis, the region of the world with the most evidence is Sub-Saharan Africa, where the countries with the most evidence are Kenya and China, followed by India and South Africa. Examining the amount of evidence in each cell of the map, we find several clusters of evidence and several gaps in the evidence: gaps in the evidence on policies and regulation that affect scientific research, access to digital technology, and innovation ecosystems; on a number of science intervention categories, including material and technical assistance for scientific research; on how two-entity partnerships and multi-stakeholder initiatives are implementing development assistance. Conversely, an unsynthesised cluster of evidence around educational programmes to promote STEM; around digital information services such as SMS services, not related to finance or health; and on RBF or PBF programmes’ impact on global health outcomes.\n",

Our first two major research reports provided positive answers to the big question that we first posed in early 2015.14 Accelerator programs — in many countries and many sectors — are indeed having an overall impact on revenue, employee, and investment growth. The second aim of the collaboration is to dig beneath the overall effects to determine exactly\nwhere and how accelerator impacts are influenced by program design choices and ecosystem conditions. Here, we must be wary of generalizing current findings to the full range of accelerator programs and ecosystem conditions across emerging markets.",
      "Key Recommendations": "As we expand these efforts, we must remain aware of blind spots in our sampling processes. We must seek out programs that are different by design, targeting different types of entrepreneurs (such as those not seeking high-risk equity investment in order to become\nthe next unicorn). We must also find ways to modify our research processes so that they can tease out the subtle-but-important nuances across regions and cities.\n",

      "Key Findings": "In conclusion, it is the authors opinion that currently there is a relatively active, small, cacao research community in Colombia that has been in part energized by the current activities the cacao sector related to the Peace Process and in part driven by the international cacao market. With the understanding that, in general the community is currently underfunded and in consequence cannon support the needs of the sector, it is our recommendation that the first and important step in developing long-term strategy for increasing, organizing and supporting financially the research on cacao in Colombia will be the establishment and funding of the proposed permanent CRC working group that will provide leadership and advocacy, and will set common priorities and support the needs of the cacao research community in Colombia. More detailed proposal needs to be develop and offered for consideration to potential funding agencies including Colombian Ministry of Agriculture, USAID, USDA-FAS and others.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "Key Recommendations are to development a 5-year, 10-year and future vision plans with specific research priorities and global needs assessment to consolidate and integrate the many prior assessments. Also, work with the existing national and international structure reviewed above to develop coordinated funding nodes and specific programs at each level of the cacao value chain for research to reduce redundancy, increase focus on priority topics and foster interdisciplinary research. Development of a coordinated framework for funding the nodes to consolidate funding to fewer, larger programs with coordinated priority areas. Development of standardized system for research proposal evaluation (peer review system) to increase the quality and impact of funded research programs and involve more scientists in the community. Development of coordinated program for capacity building to be implemented within the research programs to increase scientific capacity and train next generation of scientists. Build the competitiveness the Colombian cacao research community to compete for national and international research funding by: Building a sustainable research network supported by network manager and knowledge sharing platform. Providing the members of the network with access to information related to advances in research in the field of cacao research and in general. Providing the members of the network information with a database with members information useful for connecting with potential partners. Providing the members of the network on a regular base with information related to new funding opportunities Providing the members of the network with guidance and support for preparation of grant proposals including consultation, resources and training to build teams, and technical guidance for timely proposal writing and according to guidelines. Develop community tools and resources that will accelerate cacao research such as genetic databases, communication tools etc.\n",

After\noutlining its historical emergence, this article presents a conceptual exploration of the model, highlighting three\nmajor limitations, in spite of its highly positive intentions: its positioning of the university as an “adaptable\nfactory,” its encroachment on a distinctive space for the university in relation to society, and its particular and\ncontested conception of development.\"\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "\" In nurturing the developmental model in our contemporary institutions, with its endearing commitment to society, its protagonism and its willingness to get its hands dirty, we must not lose sight\nof the more quixotic, atemporal and ethereal aspects that are just as much a part of its being, and that\nironically may bring as much practical benefit to society as explicit efforts at development.\"\n",

The management structure and approach was risky and lacked consistent and reliable oversight. The redesign was appropriate in fixing the constraints by integrating components better, promoting cross-pollination, and shifting toward a multi-agency approach to combating corruption. Since the redesign, LPAC experienced uneven progress working with the legal and regulatory institutions but achieved the greatest results and value with the LNBA and LACC. Participation of women grew by piloting legal aid clinics, increasing Public Service Scholarships and focusing on women’s participation in judicial trainings.\n",

      "Document Title": "Facilitating Research Utilisation: A cross-sector review of research evidence",
      "Key Findings": "Critical  analysis  of  the  findings  from  this  cross-sector  literature  review,  suggests  that  there  are  a  number  of  barriers  to  research  use  that  are  common  to  managers  in  both  the  private  and  public  sectors:  access  to  research;  the  relevance  of  research;  organisational  settings, and the gap between research and practice.  Access  to  research,  and  the  problems  associated  with  gaining  easy  access  to  relevant  research findings was identified as a barrier in education, health and the business sector. Authors  have  frequently  recommended  that  research  findings  should  be  more  accessible  but  for  ideas  to  be  accessible  researchers  may  need  to  “market  their  knowledge”  to  the  practitioner  community  “as  well  as  the  research  community”  (Hemsley-Brown  andSharp, 2003).     Criticism of the relevance of research was a key factor which emerged from cross sector reviews, and was perceived to be a barrier to research use by managers in both the public sector  (healthcare  and  education)  and  in  the  business  sector.    However,  criticism  of  ‘relevance’  and  ‘access’  are  too  complex  to  address  in  this  paper.    There  has  been  considerable  debate  about the purpose  and  scope  of  management  research,  which  broadly  revolve  around  its  fragmentation  and  its  applied  nature  (Tranfield  and  Starkey,  1998).  Therefore,  to  make  recommendations  about  the  best  ways  to  ensure  that  management research   is   “relevant”   would   reduce   the   discussion   to   a   naively   simplistic   level.   Nonetheless, there were examples of ways that practitioners and managers had been able to  “use”  management  research  and  find  it  “relevant”,  for  example  by  studying  for  aMasters level degree and by building collaborative networks.",

      "Key Findings": "The major findings are that the LEAD program was successful at increasing access to higher quality education and, further, was extremely successful at targeting young women and students in remote governorates. The program was also found to be extremely successful at recruiting, enrolling, and training students to contribute to communities through development-oriented activities. Leadership training of LEAD was not considered satisfactory. Despite this, many LEAD students are playing leadership roles at the AUC. One student who has shown considerable leadership and overall success is Amira Hassanien. Her story, presented as a case study, is shared throughout the report (See Boxes).\n\nThe program compared favorably from a cost perspective relative to the alternative of sending students overseas for undergraduate studies. Compared to local options (of lower quality), costs are significant and sustainability is not ensured. The AUC is unable to increase their financial participation at this time. While AUC expressed strong interest in the program they are looking to decrease their financial commitment. At the same time, USAID would like to see AUC sharing more, not less, of program costs. There is no plan in place to seek alternative funding. Some program components, such as year abroad, are high cost and criteria for student selection could be tightened. While cost- saving measures come with tradeoffs, the financial uncertainty of LEAD requires that\nsuch steps be carefully considered.",
      "Key Recommendations": " • Further explore the competing philosophies of training and support for LEAD students as they align with the program vision. It may be more appropriate to phase in an approach that aims to orient LEAD to the AUC and community development while\ncelebrating the diversity of students, staff, and especially faculty members, rather than one which devalues their differences.\n• Accommodate a more flexible definition of student contributions in the LPI. This will allow for a more individualized approach to leadership development and would more clearly reward the level of effort in addition to the quantity of activities.\n• Hold lower cost conferences in which LEAD students would be not only attendees, but participants, and would coordinate this nation-wide effort. These students have expressed dissatisfaction with past conferences and suggested that better, more\naffordable conferences be held. LEAD should also consider linking the 2009 conference with other universities.\n• Initiate a newsletter to share information and ideas on various governorates including development projects, styles of dress, and so on, in order to further leverage the potential contributions of a diverse student body.\n• Coordinate an “Egypt Day” between LEAD and the AUC to showcase all the governorates, based on the AUC’s highly-regarded and much-enjoyed international day.",

      "Key Findings": "Value for Money\nAn impressive array of examples, summarized in this report, demonstrate how these university partnership awards totaling a modest $1,405,462 contribute toward local and national\ndevelopment goals while addressing critical components of education quality. These investments further generate substantial funds including cost-share financial contributions of $2,666,551 from the partners themselves. Furthermore, these collective investments stimulated ongoing follow-on initiatives, indirectly resulting from the HED partnerships that leveraged additional funds\ntotaling nearly seven times the initial grant award.\n\nHuman Capacity Building\nThe partnerships directly enhanced the knowledge and skills of more than 1,000 faculty and staff through degree and non-degree training. An additional 2,000 professionals, members of local\norganizations and NGOs, and local citizens outside the partner institutions also received training, and more than 4,000 were indirectly affected through training of trainers and information\ndissemination. Numerous examples were provided of how the skills and knowledge of faculty, staff, and students have resulted in new programs, curricula, courses, and outreach activities.\n\nInstitutional Capacity Strengthening\nHost country faculty described many examples of new teaching methods they had learned through the partnerships including training of trainers (TOT), active learning, participatory\nteaching-learning, critical thinking techniques, Internet conferencing, and community service learning. These changes have led to new curricula, academic programs, and/or improved\ninstruction reported by all partners. A total of 37 collaborative research projects supported 35 publications. Twenty-two community colleges have been affected directly in two national\nmovements in Vietnam and Thailand that are building community colleges systems modeled on U.S. institutions. Six partnerships introduced and supported innovative programs involving\ncommunity service; two have now become models for new national programs.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Looking ahead, partners reported that they would focus more on detailed and on-going communications among participants including the use of low-cost mechanisms such as virtual networks, conference calls, webinars, and video conferences, as well as experiment with creative teaching methods and new ways to disseminate information. Several partnerships demonstrated\nthat short-term training and the training of trainers can bring about major changes that can facilitate the scaling-up of innovative community college systems, community service learning programs, and local and regional training of doctors to enable reaching large numbers at relatively low cost.\n\nNearly all partners reported the value of attending and participating in the annual HED Synergy Conferences, citing important paybacks, particularly when host country participants present working papers as a way to exchange learning.\n\nFuture partnership programs must allow sufficient time for planning travel and visa processing for study in the United States, especially given new Homeland Security restrictions on students and academics entering the United States.",

      "Document Title": "Mid-Term Assessment of the Excellence in Higher Education Liberian Development (EHELD) Project",
      "Key Findings": "It was noted in the literature review that there are significant challenges in working with and building the capaci-\nties of inadequate systems that are themselves dependent on other inadequate systems in order to function or improve. This post-conflict context challenges all institutional capacity development initiatives. Even given these contextual challenges, the EHELD project has implemented most of the expected EHELD project activities and deliverables.\n\nThe EHELD project has been providing inputs and development to two very different universities, and two very different disciplines. EHELD determined that many of the local faculty members were unable to meet the teaching demand for courses across the entire subject areas required, especially for the revised curricula that includes experiential learning. In the short term, the need for additional capacity was met through contract and visiting faculty from outside of Liberia. The impact of the decision to focus on contract faculty and training new faculty was two fold. On the one hand, the students taking the classes from the contract and visiting faculty are impressed and grateful for the quality of instruction and attention they receive from these instructors. On the other hand, the existing local faculties at the two universities have not fully engaged with the EHELD program or the CoE concept. Existing personnel at the universities are described as treading with caution and reservation in spite of all the inputs. Additionally EHELD\npoints at problems of regular attendance of some local faculty. Local faculty perceive that they are not seen as integral to the EHELD-supported program and, in some cases, are concerned about their place at the University when the future faculty being trained abroad return.",
      "Key Recommendations": "It is important to empower the stakeholders to ensure institutionalization and sustainability. For the remainder of the project, EHELD should focus resources as much as possible on developing ownership and sustainability for those components of the project that are (a) showing results and (b) are acknowledged and supported by the host university or other stakeholders.\n\nThe creation of a CoE will take a team effort and should include all stakeholders and beneficiaries. From this point forward, EHELD needs to focus on outcomes, i.e., utility and ownership by the universities, and not just focus on achieving the PMP’s targets. The PMP helps to monitor inputs and outputs, but EHELD needs to consult with all of the faculty more closely to help them understand, address, and support the utility of what has been delivered. This will go a long way to engender ownership by the faculty and, therefore, the university.\n\nThe private sector should be engaged on an ongoing basis and be part of the planning process for activities so they will know when to provide relevant input to the university academic programming\nand Summer Start, as well as planning for internships. EHELD should reach out to new directors or presidents of relevant private sector companies and other participating organizations to introduce and orient the person(s) to EHELD, its purpose and relationship to the organization, e.g., Firestone. As with other stakeholders, EHELD should maintain regular communication about the project’s accomplishments. The development of the Liberia Engineering and Agriculture Group (LEAG) to work with EHELD and the universities’ Student Career Services Centers to develop internships may address these issues in part.",

This is positive because it reflects the flexibility in the FARA to make changes based on what is and what is not working. In addition, they have been able to find cost savings and adjust the program as\nneeded.\n\nFinding 2. A particular dimension that was emphasized by many individuals who were interviewed concerns the difficult operating environment in Egypt over the past several years. For example, CDM and CDM-CIU leaders and USAID-Egypt leadership and program management staff note that the program was mobilized and has survived through nine changes of Ministry of Higher Education ministers each of whom became convinced of the value of the program and two of whom are seen as its champions.\n\nFinding 3. CDM-CIU personnel whom the team interviewed appear to know how to carry out their specific administrative functional tasks well. Staff pointed out that the way that the CDM-CIU\nworks is very different from the way the rest of the CDM works.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Recommendation 1: Redesign the HICD to reflect a more realistic approach (see recommendation section of the report for a step by step guide).\n\nRecommendation II: Appraise the short-term overseas training program for 20 CDM personnel and 100 English Language training program personnel. Include the appraised training program in the CDM’s overall development strategy.\n\nRecommendation III: Recruit and hire at least five new CI staff to fill much needed administrative roles and higher level positions, including a CI Liaison. The Liaison should be tasked with solving\nproblems that arise between the US and Cairo.\n\nRecommendation IV: Improve the Scholar Action Plan (see recommendation section of the report for a step by step guide).\n\nRecommendation V: Be highly selective in providing masters degrees for MBA programs, select thirty percent female and only those with the highest marks and language skills. Please see Annex for fleshed out gender recommendations.\n\nRecommendation VI: Use the break between Phase 1 and Phase II to improve existing processes; specifically do the following: Develop a long term cost plan, and Create Committees (see more detail in Recommendation section).\n\nRecommendation VII: Improve the equitable distribution of opportunity to the scholarships; a few options towards reaching this goal include: a statement in the annual advertisements regarding women to allocating a percentage of awards to organizations in underserved regions.",

The scholarship program met their expectations.\n2. The scholarship program supported their career development.\n3. The program changed their mindsets in viewing the world around them.\n4. The program developed their leadership skills.\n5. The program provided them with technical skills needed in their professional roles.\n6. The program improved their communication skills.\n\nThe quantitative survey results and findings from the telephone interviews provided (1) a demographic profile of the study participants and (2) an understanding of the impact derived\nfrom the above outcomes of the PT program on their careers, economic status, contributions to the community, and self-development. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Continue USAID long-term Participant Training.\nThe effectiveness of the graduate study investment was confirmed consistently not only by the alumni of all programs themselves but also by supervisors or colleagues who commented on participants’ performance, attitudes, and competencies acquired through the PT experience.\n\n2. Consider the value of structuring cohorts for future participant training.\nThis strategy would be particularly valuable for a group of people who work in the same organization. Group learning holds the potential to catalyze organizational impact by harnessing the collective intelligence of a learning group such as a cohort of scholarship recipients.\n\n3. Consider inclusion of families for US-based scholarships.\nThe most consistently reported recommendation from US-trained alumni was for the revision of the current USAID Indonesia policy against accompanying dependents on study-abroad tours\nby allowing trainees to apply for J-2 visas for immediate family members.1 This program policy adjustment would put USAID PT programs in line with the policies of other U.S. government-\nfunded scholarships for graduate study or mid-career training (Fulbright and Humphrey Fellowships) as well as with those of three additional major graduate scholarship programs for Indonesians: the Directorate for Human Resources, Directorate General of Higher Education (DIKTI); Indonesia Endowment Fund for Education (LPDP); and AusAid.",

Build USAID STIP M&E Community of Practice (COP): To advance effectively STIP and the STIP/M&E nexus, fostering community is essential, with participation from Washington and Missions. Within this community, and with others in the Agency, content should be shared, such as innovative and “first-mover” approaches to STIP/M&E (e.g., Development Objectives, creative resource leveraging, and custom STIP/M&E indicators). This COP should be action-oriented, working together on priority STIP M&E tasks (e.g., F standard indicator revision), and could do so through a virtual TDY, for example.\n\n2. Integrate Further STIP/M&E across USAID: To leverage this important tool for development work, it is essential to help colleagues label current STIP work as such, identify STIP opportunities, understand that STIP is not an “add-on”, and provide Agency-wide resources in the STIP/M&E nexus. Examples include weaving STIP into Agency programming in an effective manner, such as clarifying “innovation” in mission RFAs (defining it as “better, faster, cheaper, more sustainable”), and requiring STIP indicators for new awards.\n\n3. Champion “Spatial Thinking”: To improve program design, decrease unintended consequences, and tell stories within and outside of USAID, geospatial tools and spatial thinking should be\nchampioned. Attendees noted the importance that each person act as a STIP/M&E Champion within their pocket of the Agency.\n\n4. Increase STIP M&E Agency-Wide Resources: To support USAID priorities, as well as event takeaways, The Lab should create a STIP M&E Toolkit or One-Stop Shop for STIP M&E resources, including databases, individual bureau resources, and development partner knowledge.",

Thirteen out of\nfourteen of the SSHIELD scholars completed master’s degrees in education by successfully completing their coursework and defending their theses. With additional support from Indiana\nUniversity and South Sudanese faculty, the fourteenth scholar is expected to defend her thesis while in South Sudan and receive a master’s degree. As a result of the training and experiences\nthey received from SSHIELD, all 14 women have returned to South Sudan and are now prepared to take on leadership roles in South Sudan’s educational system in areas such as curriculum development, teacher education, educational policy, and educational research. For its part, the visiting faculty program has not only prepared the 8 visiting South Sudanese faculty members\nto support the SSHIELD network, it also has equipped them to contribute to gender equity and conflict-sensitive curricula and policies in South Sudan.\n\nThe SSHIELD program graduates demonstrate that an ethnically and geographically diverse group of South Sudanese women can complete rigorous higher education degree programs and contribute meaningfully to the development of their country, especially during the ongoing crisis. With the SSHIELD network taking root and with the support of the Ministry of Education,\nthe situation is now primed for a change in the predominately male sphere of higher education in South Sudan.\n\nWhile tremendous gains have been made during the SSHIELD project in strengthening the qualifications of program participants, further support is recommended upon their return to South Sudan to ensure that the SSHIELD network is empowered to make sustainable change in South Sudanese institutions and share their knowledge and skills with a broader number of students, teachers, faculty, and administrators.",

      "Document Title": "Periperi U Phase III Summative Evaluation",
      "Key Findings": "Focus Area 1 - Institutionalisation: The Periperi U partners have successfully continued their efforts to embed the disaster risk domain in their respective home institutions. Administrative and\nfinancial processes have been integrated into university systems, with most home universities providing significant in-kind contributions in the form of infrastructure, administrative support\nand staff time. In general, programme activities have had good support from university leaders and administrators - the result of what is seen as an important area of work from a national perspective that is also given credibility by external funding and, in particular, by a consortium of African universities.\n\nFocus Area 2 – Short courses: The targets in this stream were met in all but three partner nodes; for around half, performance in some aspect of this focus area was well above expectations. Although more courses were presented in Phase III (58 compared to 47 in Phase II; 19 of them in 2012), somewhat fewer participants were reached - 1,447 (average 25 per course) compared to 1,572\n(average 33 per course) in Phase II (this situation might still change as Phase III draws to a close). Participants came from a wide range of sectors and experiences, thus reinforcing the importance of\nthis focus area for reaching and building the capacities of stakeholders immersed in practice, and in many cases in influential positions.\n\nFocus Area 3 – Academic courses: Postgraduate courses in DRR/M are particularly important; they are seen by stakeholders as preparing a new cadre of professionals who can lead a range of\nactivities across sectors where this field of work needs to be embedded. Only UG chose to focus exclusively on integrating modules into existing academic courses as a result of their particular context. The implementation of academic programmes and modules continued in Phase, with partners meeting targets to the extent that they could control; two Master’s programmes (Moi and USTHB17) are still awaiting approval.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Key Recommendation 1: Improve critical performance areas of the consortium for sustained impact. Strengthen key capacities and management processes for durable, authoritative and\nimpactful results by maintaining those key aspects that enable success, building on strengths, and improving aspects of management.\n\nKey Recommendation 2: Attend to structure and responsibilities. Reconceptualise and/or strengthen the secretariat without weakening it, given its critical role as a major driving force and\nreason for the success of the consortium.\n\nKey Recommendation 3: Strengthen DRS scholarship through an emphasis on home institution capacities and research. Strengthen research and supervision to demonstrate and encourage\ncontext-sensitive, boundary-spanning, engaged scholarship in the disaster risk domain. This includes an emphasis on developing a critical mass of academic staff with proven capacities in\nhome universities.",

      "Document Title": "USAID/Kosovo Transformational Leadership Impact and Performance Evaluation Report",
      "Key Findings": "Notwithstanding initial implementation delays due to extraneous factors, WL and its University partners have done well in adhering to the timeline and maintaining focus on both the essential steps in the sequenced approach to implementation and the realization of the development objectives of the project. The Partnerships Component is in the first year of its implementation and so far is on track to meet its final deliverables.\n\nFollowing an assessment of the implementation of the UP Action Plan, which showed that very little had been achieved under the Plan’s priority areas, the project has identified three focus areas of support for implementation of this component: (i) enhancing revenue generation and financial viability; (ii) improving the quality of academic staff and teaching; and (iii) developing the Rectorate’s management, internal communications and public relations capabilities. As a part of ensuring ownership and sustainability of\ninitiatives, a 33-member Advisory Committee (AC), consisting of members from the government, public universities, civil society groups, private sector, and youth and disadvantaged populations, has been established to advise the project on relationships with stakeholders, political environment, and project audience. AC has identified several “Grand Challenges” in Kosovo’s workforce development, and is exploring ways in which institutions of higher education in Kosovo could address these challenges. There are some concerns, however, about the effectiveness of the committee, principally because it has too many members and because the members have full time jobs and are unable to devote the time needed to provide oversight. Smaller sub-committees are being constituted to speed up the decision-making process and reduce individual burden.",
      "Key Recommendations": "• Despite the fact that the TLP project has faced several delays as a result of the political situation in Kosovo and the changes at University of Prishtina, the project is on track and WL would be well-advised to maintain the focus and direction, especially in the next year, which will be pivotal to setting in place processes that will have a critical impact on the final outcomes. It would be important for WL to begin collecting information on the indicators to ensure progress is as planned as the Partnerships component winds down next year and the project itself in a few years.\n• The UP Action Plan has not seen much progress since its inception and needs a lot of support before it can become operational. It will be important for WL to field the best team of consultants to help think through the three identified priority areas, and lay down critical markers of progress over the remaining time-period.\n• Further, US university partnerships are expected to contribute significantly to strengthening teaching and assessment quality, and success on this front would require WL to maintain relentless focus on details and linkages across the education-labor market continuum.\n• The high-profile support from USAID and GOK and the surrounding publicity seems to have resulted in a highly inflated set of expectations among the UP administration and the faculty, who\nlook at the project to deliver far more than what it is designed to. It is important to correct this at the earliest, especially since a high level of interest among these stakeholders is critical to drive\nsuccess of the project.",

As development cooperation needs new and fresh ideas, more risk taking and more systematic and effective inclusion of private actors, SWFF provides a meaningful contribution to the sector. Many interviewees use SWFF as a positive example of an innovation in itself that aims to contribute to development thinking as well as to practical solutions on the ground. The MTR team fully endorses the move towards a SWFF Fourth Call for proposals and early discussions (well before a final impact evaluation) on a possible future iteration of SWFF.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Based on the findings of the MTR, the team suggests that at the strategic level, SWFF should:\n§ Continue to systematically contribute to the [thinking around the] evolution of the GC model as a key instrument of ODA and as part of a sequencing of financing modalities.\n§ Continue to reinforce and invest in the “SWFF community of practice” approach between innovators, and with SWFF as part of a wider network.\n\nAt the operations and implementation level, SWFF should:\n§ Seek ways to further reduce selection time and the burden of PAS processes.\n§ Continue efforts to provide a more differentiated approach in the acceleration support process in relation to the level of development of the country; the size, experience and type (private, NGO, research) of innovator; etc.",

      "Key Findings": "Where data was available and sufficient to run quantitative analyses, we found positive, statistically significant results. In each of the three cases, we found varying levels of data availability.\nIn the first two, GBI Connectivity and BTCA, we were able to run statistical analyses to quantitatively investigate the relationship between investments in STIP public goods and development outcomes. In those cases, we found meaningful results, though they have some data limitations.\n\nOur findings also suggest that USAID played a key role in each case. The Lab plays a key role convening partners, offering technical expertise, and providing the seed capital that de-risks early-stage investments, catalyzing further investment. What follows are short syntheses of each case.",
      "Key Recommendations": "The lab should consider strengthening data collection, harnessing its distinct convening power, nurturing senior relationships and working more seamlessly with Missions. USAID is currently lacking much of the data required to measure its STIP public goods investments with quantitative rigor – particularly around development outcomes. However we did find statistical significance in our regressions and also that USAID played a critical convening role, utilizing the Agency’s senior-level political relationships, which should be further enhanced. Missions are also often not fully aware of – or have not fully bought into – the projects, in part due to the Missions’ more widespread challenges with communication and capacity. To address these, we propose the following recommendations:\n\n Collect more granular data to improve learning, evaluation, and resource allocation\n Utilize USAID’s distinct convening power to ‘move the ball forward’\n Nurture senior-level political relationships within the U.S. government and in partner countries\n Transmit knowledge more freely with country Missions\n\nWhile this study suggests that STIP public goods investments yield meaningful results, further investigation into USAID’s return on investment versus other investments, will require more rigorous collection of data. The data that we have collected suggests positive outcomes, and in some cases accelerated progress\ntowards development outcomes, however due to some of the data gaps, we believe these findings should be interpreted cautiously.",

The conversation needs to\nbe a two-way street during research, innovation, and then scaling up.",

      "Key Findings": "a. Fertilizer is seen by many as essential if we are going to feed 9 billion people by 2050. There is an opportunity for IFDC to be part of the next “ever-green revolution” by developing and disseminating fertilizer and soil fertility management technologies that are more environmentally sound and more profitable for farmers.\nb. Pursue applied research by agronomists, soil scientists, and economists to develop cost-effective fertilizer products and soil fertility management practices, and work with pluralistic extension systems to extend these best practices to farmers.\nc. Revise the strategy to make applied research programs on a few big questions about fertilizer and soil fertility as the strategy drivers (move away from the projects driving the agenda).",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. The first and recommended scenario is to maintain IFDC uniqueness. The constructive feedback above basically assumes that IFDC would continue its current definition as both a research institution and a project implementing organization, do the necessary rebuilding, and make the changes needed to regain and preserve its uniqueness. But there are other possible scenarios to consider at this time of re-visioning and strategic thinking. The review team has sketched out a few possible scenarios with some pros and cons, but these are by no means exhaustive.\n\n2. A second scenario could be a more radical change. IFDC today has lost much of its research capacity and research funding. At the same time, IFDC has grown and increased capacity as a value-\nchain/agribusiness/markets project design and implementation non-profit organization. One scenario that might evolve from the re-visioning is for IFDC to continue along this growth path and eventually divest itself of most of the research parts of the institution and evolve into a project implementing organization only.\n\n3. A third scenario with significant change could be the reverse of the first scenario above, with IFDC becoming a research institution, divesting itself of investments in projects, and no longer seeking new business to implement new projects. This scenario might include perhaps small action research “pilot projects” that would be testing specific hypotheses, but dissemination of the research products would need to be accomplished through partnerships with other development organizations in the field.",

Key\nadvantages of the EPA Research Programme are\nthat (i) it can rely on and utilise the EPA in-house\nexpertise (other sections of the EPA being the end-\nusers of the research outputs) and (ii) it has built over\nthe years, strong connections with the DHPCLG and\nwith the other funders in the water area.\n",

      "Document Title": "The Role of Science, Technology, Innovation, and Partnerships in the Future of USAID",
      "Key Findings": "USAID possesses three strengths that stand out in the realm of\nSTI+P development: the agency’s on-the-ground understanding of STI+P needs; its convening capability and relationships with host countries to scale STI+P investments; and its ability to learn and adapt to diverse development environments as well as new science and technology.\n\nFirst, through its U.S. and host-country staff, USAID has substan-\ntial on-the-ground knowledge and understanding of the development opportunities and constraints in the countries where it works. After decades of building relationships across societies and institutions, USAID missions, backed by strong technical capabilities in Washington, are in a position to work with country leaders and senior officials of other U.S. government agencies to identify and articulate local development needs and priorities.\n\nSecond, local knowledge and capability enable USAID to catalyze partners and implementers within host countries and among scien-\ntists, engineers, donors, businesses, nongovernmental organizations, and others across a broad spectrum of sectors ranging from agriculture and health to economics and governance. USAID’s imprimatur can help scale advances through such methods as strategic funding, convening diverse partners toward a common goal, leveraging resources, and influencing policies of host governments. Given the increasing importance of scale in measuring successful outcomes, USAID’s strength as a cata-\nlyst can also have important consequences in implementing solutions to social and economic challenges. Free-market mechanisms are needed.\n\nThird, USAID can learn and adapt to diverse development envi-\nronments as well as emerging science and technologies if it applies more broadly the analytical and evaluation tools developed in the last decade. Successful application of science, technology, and innovation rely in all countries on an enabling environment. USAID can use its presence, tools, resources and relationships to help strengthen and sustain that environment. To have greater impact, it will be necessary for STI+P planning and investments to be much more tightly integrated and coordinated across USAID, with leadership and incentives reflecting this integration as a priority at all levels. The Global Development Lab, the technical bureaus, and the administrator’s science advisor are well positioned to serve as conduits to effect this integration, but will need to devote more resources to productive engagement with missions and each other, determining together where the agency has a strategic advantage for innovation and what existing and new tools and inclusive partnerships should be developed to make progress.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Accelerate the transformation of USAID into a global leader and catalyst in applying science, technology, and innovation to developing country challenges, drawing on resources from across the U.S. government, developing countries, the public and private research enterprise, research universities in the U.S. and\nabroad, and bilateral and multilateral development agencies.\n2. Strengthen host countries’ institutional capacity to apply science, technology, and innovation in their own development, as well as to ensure training of individuals in higher education and\nprofessional schools both in-country and in the U.S.\n3. Elevate scaling of successful interventions to be a core USAID\npriority, to expand the impact and improve the sustainability\nand cost-effectiveness of science, technology, and innovation\napplied to development challenges.\n4. Expand investments in science, technology, and innovation that\nengage and empower women.",

Other programs offer features that are more supportive of face to face collaboration between\nU.S. partner scientists and host country PIs, support to host-country research institutions, and\nconvening that bring together researchers with other stakeholders, including polity makers.\n PEER Researchers are satisfied with several elements of the program; a) networking;\nb) capacity building opportunities; c) NAS support; and d) the grant cycle and proposal process. US\npartner scientists were measurably less satisfied than PEER PIs.\n PIs gave PEER implementer NAS high praise for responsiveness, engagement, guidance, and\nflexibility.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "1.1. Expand the type and number of partnership organizations to the private\nsector (e.g., General Electric) and foundations (e.g., Bill and Melinda.

      "Key Findings": " Of the 30 innovations reviewed, 21 are being tested in another country. This does\nnot mean they have necessarily been adopted.5\nHowever, terms such as ‘innovation,’\n‘test,’ ‘proven,’ ‘scaled,’ and ‘transferred’ are not used consistently or clearly defined in\npractice. This can sometimes create ambiguity in understanding the effectiveness of DO4\nactivities.\n Most of the innovations transferred are from FSO (six of eight to Kenya and three\nof three to Malawi) and have not scaled yet or reached a point of sustainability.6 It is\nstill early in implementation for DO4 activities (less than three years), and all are still in\nthe testing phase. Additionally, innovation promotion within India is qualitatively\ndifferent from international innovation transfer in that specific additional costs and\nchallenges can arise.\n Offices within USAID/India approach DO4 differently based on their office\nstrategies or mandates, funding requirements, and the existing structures or\ncultures of their sectors or offices within USAID. Of the innovations examined, certain\noffices (OSSI, Energy) focused more on innovation testing and scaling within India\n(DO3) than on international transfer (DO4). Whether or how offices are engaging in\npromoting transfer depends on each office’s mandate, goals, and financing.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Recommendation 3.1. Define DO4 terminology and use\nconsistently throughout the Mission. Many terms\npertaining to innovations and innovation transfers are not\nunderstood clearly or used consistently. Establishing\ncommon definitions of key terms would facilitate communication as well as innovation identification, implementation, measurement, and\ncomparison.\n\nRecommendation 3.2. Expand indirect support for innovation transfer through other\napproaches. In addition to the project approach, other approaches identified through the\nevaluation and used within the innovation promotion space include: partnerships (such as\nMillennium Alliance); market for innovations; grand challenge/crowdsourcing;\nbrokering/matchmaking. Broadening the approach to DO4 would allow various offices to\ncontinue to contribute to DO4 but not exclusively through project activities.\nRecommendation 3.3. Coordinate more strategically with other Missions. To increase the\nlikelihood of partner Mission engagement, options include:\n Establishing innovation partnership goals within partner Mission strategies or project\nappraisal documents.\n Assigning a point of contact between Missions for DO4 work.\n Marketing to Missions based on their existing sector priorities to build interest an\ndemand.",

Building on previous successes, the\npartnership has continued to expand following the commitment of the partners to\ncontinue the research initiatives into the future. As new empirical studies get underway\nand the network expands, we can draw a few lessons from the partnership experience\nwithin the framework of the PPP construct.\n\nThe first lessons are that Open AIR demonstrates that PPP categories are not closed.\nIndeed, PPP objectives need to include foundational research that is separated from the\ncurrent focus on access to benefits of knowledge and innovation through products and\nservices deliveries. PPPs remain understudied and, in essence, the relevance of research\npartnerships such as Open AIR lies in their ability to re-imagine and push the envelopes of\nPPPs with slightly different emphasis. As the UN SDGs get underway there is already a\nstrong consciousness for the creation of innovative partnerships toward accountability and\ntheir effective implementation.\n\nCertainly from the Open AIR experience, the boundaries\nof PPPs can be pushed so long as partners have shared goals and objectives and are able to\nThe second lesson from a cross-regional IP and knowledge governance research\npartnership is that such initiative is needed to deeply root PPPs in the development\nagenda. So far, quibbles over the development agenda in IP have built on lingering mistrusts across the developing-developed country geopolitical divide. Those historic\nsuspicions have since engulfed IP and knowledge government institutions, which often\nliterarily walk and work in the delicate balance of these deep-seated crossfires.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "Open AIR encourages the\nexpansion of its network members to include expertise in knowledge-based industries and\ngrassroots entrepreneurship.

      "Key Recommendations": "Despite the variability in evidence, we identified several key take-aways enabling us to make the following specific recommendations for open data practitioners and de-\ncision makers, including donors like USAID, on how to better leverage open data as a new asset for development.\n\nFocus on and define the problem, understand the user, and be aware of local conditions. The most successful open data projects are those that are designed and implemented with keen attention to the nuances of local conditions; have a clear sense of the problem to be solved; and understand the needs of the users and intended beneficiaries. Projects with an overly broad, ill-defined or “fuzzy” problem focus, or those that have not examined the likely users, are less likely to generate the meaningful real-world impacts, regardless\nof funds available. Too often, open data projects have less impact because they are overly data-focused rather than problem- and user-focused.\n\nFocus on readiness, responsiveness, and change management. Implementing open data projects often requires a level of readiness among all stakeholders, as well as a\ncultural transformation, in the way governments and institutions collect, share, and consume information. For development funders, however, this important determi-\nnant of success can imply difficult decisions regarding high-potential open data initiatives in developing economies that lack clear institutional readiness or demonstrated responsiveness to feedback.",

Improving Grain Legume Productivity: Meaningful\nadvances in increasing bean and cowpea productivity\non smallholder farms were achieved through the\ndevelopment and release of 93 high yielding varieties\nwith resistances to economically important diseases\nand insect pests, adaptations to drought, high\ntemperature and low fertility, and preferred grain\nquality traits. The development of sustainable\nbio-controls for cowpea insect pests will close\nthe yield gap in cowpea systems. (B.1 - 6)\nC. Improving Smallholder Farmer Integrated Crop\nManagement Decision Making and Livelihoods:\nInnovative approaches (innovation platforms), tools\n(decision support aids, SAWBO, soil maps), and\nmodels (community based seed multiplication) will\nenable marginalized smallholder bean and cowpea\nfarmers to have access to technologies and make\nbetter integrated crop management decisions.\n(C.1 – 5)\nD. Improving Human Nutrition and Health: Landmark\nfindings on the roles of cowpea and bean in reducing\ngrowth faltering (stunting) and gut inflammation in\nyoung children, respectively, plus the identification\nof health promoting bioactive compounds in\ncowpea will give rise to food-based strategies for\nimproving child growth and nutrition in nutritionally\ncompromised regions of the world. (D.1 and 2)\nE. Strengthening Human and Institutional Capacity:\nA new generation of grain legume scientists, with\ncutting edge research skills and a mindset for\ninnovation, who appreciate the value of\nmultidisciplinary collaboration and are networked,\nwill be returning to their home countries and research\ninstitutions to be problem solvers, catalysts of\nsustainable change, and advocates for strengthened\ngrain legume value chains. (E.1-3)\nF. Evidence of Achievement and Impact:\nDemonstrated impacts to the grain legume sectors\nin both Feed the Future countries and the U.S. and\nscholarly research publications give evidence of\nthe incredible performance by program PIs.\n(F.1-4; Appendix 3 and 4)\nG. Administrative Leadership by Michigan State\nUniversity: Effective technical and administrative\nleadership by the Management Office at Michigan\nState University has contributed to bringing\ninternational distinction to the DGP CRSP and LIL.\nIt is now recognized as a premier multidisciplinary\ncommunity of fundamental to applied scientists\ncollaborating in grain legume research and committed\nto innovation and transformation of grain legume\nvalue chains.

      "Key Findings": "Our work on poverty dynamics has\nestablished three fundamental and\ncomplementary pathways into and\nout of poverty: assets, capacities and\nrisk. Our field trials around the world\nhave contributed significantly to our\nunderstanding of these dynamics and\nprovided the opportunity to design and\nevaluate programs intended to reduce\npoverty and promote resilience.\nIn the broadest sense, ending the\nneed for development aid will depend\non our ability to continually shrink\nthe number of poor households over\ntime. While cash transfers sustain\nthe very poorest households in\ntimes of dire need, we could achieve\nmuch bigger long-term impacts\nfrom a contingent transfer—such as\nagricultural insurance—that keeps\nvulnerable households from falling\ninto poverty. This phenomenon, which\nwe have called the “social protection\nparadox,” presents a real opportunity\nfor promoting resilience when scaled\nto national social protection budgets, particularly for countries in Sub-\nSaharan Africa and others that face\na growing threat of weather-related\nshocks.\nWhile the policy focus is often on\nassets, research shows that stress,\ndepression or a deterioration in\nphysical health can affect cognitive\nfunction, resulting in hardship that\nitself reinforces stress and depression.\nIn the development context, this kind\nof self-reinforcing loop—effectively\na behavioral poverty trap—means\nthat the experience of poverty itself\ncan influence an individual’s future\ndecisions about productivity.\n",

      "Document Title": "An External Performance Evaluation of the Feed the Future Innovation Labs for Applied Wheat Genomics and Climate Resistant Chickpea ",
      "Key Findings": "Concerning research outcomes, both ILs have met or exceeded many of their initial goals. In\nsome cases, the programs have had to adjust in the face of unforeseeable difficulties or\nchanging circumstances and opportunities. The adjustments have been adopted after proper\nconsultation and likely enhance the long-term impact of the labs. Both lab directors have been\nreasonably nimble in adapting to changes and challenges.\n\nThe AWGIL and the CRCIL have faced at least two common challenges in their research\nprograms. In both cases the capacity to create data seems to exceed the capacity to manage\nthose data and optimize their value to the program and to other scientists. This situation\nreflects a broad issue in the scientific community today, and it is a significant challenge to the\nwork conducted in these ILs.\n\nConsistent with the priorities of USAID, the AWGIL and the CRCIL have attempted to be gender-sensitive in their research activities. The nature of the research leaves little scope for engagement with women as users of the final technologies or in systems that might reach the\nfarm level. Therefore, the primary mechanism whereby these labs can engage women is\nthrough capacity building of female scientists. The underrepresentation of women in science,\nparticularly in agricultural sciences, in the target countries has made it difficult for both ILs to\nidentify and recruit highly qualified women into their degree training programs. The AWGIL\nand CRCIL made thoughtful efforts to recruit women. While both ILs had and met overall\nquantitative targets for trainees, establishment and ongoing management of gender targets\nbetween USAID and IL leadership was inconsistent.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "The two labs reviewed here have made significant advances in accordance with the initial\nproposals. Achieving the development impacts on smallholder farmers that USAID seeks will\nrequire considerably more time and continued efforts along the lines that each IL has been\npursuing. The EET recommends that future activities emphasize:\n1. Data management and software systems to ensure optimal use of the resources\ndeveloped under the ILs.\n2. Increased efforts to engage partners from South Asia in degree training and in the use of\nGenomic-Estimated Breeding Value (GEBV) modeling for Genomic Selection (GS) in\norder to achieve lasting impact in wheat.\n3. Efforts to leverage new chickpea resources developed over the last five years to move\nfrom pre-breeding to breeding activities.\n4. Establishment of mechanisms for systematic assessment of learning outcomes from\ntraining efforts, especially short-term training activities.\n5. Careful consideration of the optimal distribution of funding for administrative personnel\nand scientific personnel if a program attempts to move chickpea activities from pre-\nbreeding to breeding.",

      "Key Findings": "GIP-IL has made significant progress in three out of six research\nobjectives (1, 2 and 6) aimed at developing poultry with enhanced\nNDV and heat resistance.\n\nWith the introduction of the velogenic approach to the research\nprogram, GIP-IL experienced a significant expansion of program\nactivities, a change in resource allocation, and additional capacity\nbuilding requirements that caused a substantial delay in progress.\n\nMany infrastructure, logistical, human capacity, and institutional\nconstraints hindered project progress.\n\nGIP-IL identified many aspects of the genetics behind NDV\nresistance and provided high-quality training to research team\nmembers and students.\n\nStakeholders are concerned that sustainable breeding of improved\nchickens will require long-term support for poultry producers.\n\nSome key research activities have not started. They include: 1)\ndevelopment of an economical low-density Single Nucleotide\nPolymorphism (SNP) panel for genetic selection of disease\nresistance; and 2) validation of disease resistance in African\nindigenous chicken population using such a low-density SNP panel.\n\nStakeholders consider the research conducted by GIP-IL to be of\nhigh quality but, in order to be of real value, it must be validated\nand applied.\n\nObjectives 3, 4, and 5 remain to be started and continued work is\nneeded on Objectives 2 and 6.\n\nActivities addressing Objective 5 and 6, which involve developing\nvalidated breeding stocks, have yet to be completed and, according\nto stakeholders, will require time and investment beyond the\ncurrent project timeline.\n\nStakeholders support a participatory model that takes into account\nspecific contexts for developing the breeding and distribution plan\n(BDP).\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "GIP-IL project implementers should conduct a detailed assessment of existing capacity and built-in some flexibility in order\nto develop a comprehensive and practical implementation schedule.\n\nProject implementers should use the management and research metrics developed at the start of the project to measure\nall aspects of the project on an ongoing basis.\n\nProject implementers should, if allocated more time and investment, prioritize the research objectives that remain to be\nmet and develop a clear implementation plan.\n\nThe GIP-IL program should stay focused on completing the discovery phase of work, and carefully design and use the low-\ndensity SNP panel.\n\nTo attain significant, long-term, improved NDV and heat stress resistance chickens, future GIP-IL efforts must focus on\nsustainably developing the validated and improved breeding stocks.\n\nProject implementers need to conduct several more years of research and produce multiple generations to show\nsustainable effects.\n\nAll relevant stakeholders should continue to examine the advantages and disadvantages of natural exposure and controlled\nexposure for completing Objective 2.\n\nPoultry value chain research should include increased participation of farmers and other community stakeholders, including\nwomen, to ensure sustainability.\n\nManagement and research team members should review the existing information sharing guidelines to ensure all\nparticipants are up-to-date on the research metrics collected and recorded.\n\nAdditional time should be allowed in order to complete validation and distribution of chickens for breeding. In order to\nmeet GIP-IL’s goal of developing chickens with enhanced NDV and heat resistance, funding will need to be extended.",

      "Key Findings": "Partnership experience: The partnership experience has been largely positive for both Pakistani and\nU.S. universities. Affiliation with U.S. universities has elevated the prestige of the Pakistani universities,\nand the partnerships have been instrumental in building the centers’ capacities in curriculum, applied\nresearch capacity, and sector engagement. On the U.S. side, partnerships have enabled U.S. faculty and\nstudents to understand sector-related issues from a Pakistani perspective and helped U.S. universities\nrecruit students. Challenges to the partnerships have included aligning the partners’ priorities to achieve\nlasting change.\n\nEffectiveness of components: The project encompasses multiple components:\n\nForeign exchanges: International exchanges have been transformative in enhancing students’ research\ncapacity and developing professional focus. Faculty exchanges have been less popular, initially due to\npoor planning, but also because prolonged travel can be difficult for faculty.\n\nApplied/joint research: Each CAS pursues applied research in a manner that best serves its needs. For\nNUST and UETP, this has meant awarding grants to both CAS faculty and outside experts, while MUET\nfocuses on developing internal capacity around a defined research agenda. Potential clients/collaborators\nin the sector vary in their satisfaction with CAS research; MUET-associated organizations are very\nsatisfied, NUST organizations are less so, and UETP organizations see potential but have not seen\nresults.\n\nLab utilization: Each CAS developed high-quality research labs specific to sector needs. Procurement\nchallenges caused extensive delays in operationalizing labs, and now each center is developing utilization\nstrategies to guide student and faculty use, as well as commercialization.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Strengthen industry-academic linkages to foster a better understanding of industry problems and\ncommercialization of CAS/NUST resources: CAS/NUST should deploy its faculty to identify the needs\nof specific organizations and to design solutions. Moreover, as it strategizes its outreach and relationship\ndevelopment, CAS/NUST should engage high-level energy-sector professionals on its corporate advisory\nboard to advise the center. The center should also engage the University Office of Research, Innovation,\nand Commercialization (ORIC) and HEC to help build stronger relationships with sector organizations.\n\nDevelop comprehensive marketing and outreach efforts: CAS/NUST should establish a dedicated\nmarketing and outreach unit to design and implement a comprehensive strategy to analyze market needs\nand to develop messaging across multiple sector segments. The strategy should address the market for\nCAS consulting, training, lab testing, applied research, and career placement of students. The unit should\nalso dedicate resources to focus exclusively on a strategy for developing and procuring funding from\ndomestic and international donors.\n\nEstablish a technology center to offer short-term training courses and energy audits: CAS/NUST\nshould work with USAID and HEC to produce a comprehensive business plan for a technology center\nthat defines realistic market analyses, resources, revenue potential, seed funding sources, and the time\nhorizon needed to achieve sustainability. Once the center is established, NUST can leverage faculty\nexpertise to provide skills-based, short-term training using center resources as a means of generating revenue. However, the readiness of faculty to deliver such training is a prerequisite for such an endeavor.",

      "Key Findings": "Having established that the current funding levels for basmati R&D are woefully inadequate and that\nPakistan’s basmati export could be increased by additional funding for basmati R&D, the question arises\nas to the best remedy. Two important aspects need attention: first, the source of funding, and second,\nthe oversight and transmission mechanism of the funding.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Modern models of R&D funding rely on a combination of public grants, industry contributions, and fees\nand levies. However, a substantial increase from Pakistan’s public exchequer is unlikely. One option is\nto institute a cess (levy) fund based on contributions from farmers. An expanded version could involve\nall participants of value chain, so that all participants’ resources can be pooled for mutual benefit, given\nthat rice R&D is advantageous to all stakeholders in the value chain. However, the expectation that\nPakistan’s farmers will willingly agree to an R&D levy is unrealistic, as their ability to pay is uncertain and\nthey frequently complain about input costs and lack of subsidies.\nAlternately, the other end of the chain might be more conducive to such an initiative. Processing and\nexport stages involve the greatest value addition for rice. Such stages of the value chain are also better\ndocumented, better organized, and more cognizant of the need for better R&D to be able to compete in international markets. The burden of a cess at the export end is less onerous than at the farm end, and\nthe amount that can be collected will be greater. Given that the exporters gain the most in the rice value\nchain, it is only fair that R&D contributions should come from them. And, imposing a levy at the farm\nend could distort the growers’ behavior to the detriment of rice cultivation if they switch to other crops.",

      "Key Findings": "There were numerous highlights throughout the program’s implementation period as well as\nnumerous lessons learned. It took some time, for example, to recruit the first group of\nstudents. At the commencement of the program, NDIGD was not affiliated with a specific\ncollege at the university and had to work overtime to share the opportunities with its many\naffiliated faculty, who then passed the information on to their students. Key relationships were\ndeveloped with the Kroc Institute (Peace Studies) and the Eck Center for Global Health. Both\norganizations were then eager to partner due to the many students who went abroad from\ntheir programs.\n\nOver the course of the implementation, one-on-one meetings were instituted to help students\nunderstand the impact, if any, on any fellowship support they were already receiving from the\nuniversity. This was most concerning to PhD students who received living stipends. NDIGD\nwas able to work with the student, their faculty advisors, as well as their departments to\naddress any questions or concerns. In addition, conducting several meetings with fellows prior\nto their departure proved to be an effective way for fellows and NDIGD staff to get to know\neach other. We used these opportunities to let fellows know of the various resources available\non campus and externally to help them in making travel preparations as well as living abroad.",
      "Key Recommendations": "As previously noted, this program has grown tremendously at the University of Notre Dame,\nand NDIGD intends to continue the program post-USAID funding. As an institution we are\nalways looking out for opportunities for our students to help them excel in their different\nprofessions and gain skills and knowledge that will help them become future leaders in global\ndevelopment. To this end, we plan to grow the program into a sustainable model for the future\nthrough partnerships with individual benefactors and the private sector. This has already been\naccomplished through an endowed gift that will support short-term fellowships for\nundergraduate and graduate students.",

      "Document Title": "Measuring the Green Revolution: the Impact of Research on Wheat and Rice Production",
      "Key Findings": "This report has outlined the main conceptual\nand empirical considerations in evaluating the\nimpact of international agricultural research on\ncrop production in developing nations. The\nprocess has been applied to high-yielding varie-\nties of wheat and rice.\n\nThe task of evaluation is complex. While the\nimmediate research product can be readily\nidentified, there are many problems in linking\nthis product to actual changes in production in\nthe farmers' fields. Moreover, the HYV package\nmay have a number of indirect and qualitative\nresults in addition to the direct and quantitative\neffects.\n\nThis study, after reviewing all these consider-\nations, focused On only one measure: the direct\nquantitative effect. Changes in area and yield\nwere first examined. This was followed by an\nanalysis of 'the effect of the HYV's on yield,\nusing production function and index number\ntechniques. Even this relatively narrow focus\nencountered a number of analytical difficulties.\nSome can be solved by using the techniques in\ncombination, rather than separately as in the\npast. Others are more intractable.\n\nDespite these problems, the task is not an\nimpossible one. Crude measures or approxi·\nmations have been made, and it is certainly\npossible to make further improvements in evalu-\nation. But to do so will require improved data\nand analytical techniques. Whether these will be\nforthcoming will in part depend on the need for\nimproved analysis.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Financial resources will be needed to carry\nout these tasks. Perhaps one or more of the\nmembers of the Consultative Group will provide\nfunds for this purpose in the future. Should\nsupport become available, the research could be\nadministered in a variety of ways. The newly\nestablished International Food Policy Research\nInstitute might play a role in this process\n(though this institute is not presently sponsored\nby the CG). The actual research, as in the past,\ncould well involve university scholars.\n\nIn pursuing a more precise estimate of the\neffects of technologies, several key points have\nto be recognized. First, the measurement prob-\nlems, as indicated, are severe. Sponsors need to\nhave some understanding of what can and\ncannot be readily measured. Second, some re-\nsearch activities might show considerably less\nquantitative effect than others. Such results\nmight not always be well received, but they\nought to be known if resources are to be\nallocated most effectively.\n\nIt should be recognized, of course, that\nquantitative techniques cannot measure every-\nthing. Some research programs can be justified\non other grounds. And social goals beyond\nproductivity should certainly be considered.\nRural equity issues, for example, are becoming\nincreasingly important in the planning process.",

The melting did, indeed, confirm the view stated above that\nthe committee was very displeased with AID and the termination of the\ngrant. The Program Officer and evaluators became the objects of \"benign\nhostility,\" and after two or three questions from the evaluators, it was\napparent that further evaluative questioning would aggravate the situation.\n\nThe Sociology Department was the only Department during that\nmeeting which submitted a written report on the status of its participation\nin the program. This Department appears to have been moving toward\nProgram goals. Without written reports from other Departments, and\nunable to proceed with a meaningful evaluative meeting, the evaluators\nhave too little information on which to evaluate the degree to which the\nUniversity fulfilled the purposes of the Grant Agreement.\n\nEach parson at the meeting was asked to report on that Department's\nparticipation in the project. These statements, however, give no comprehensive,\nintegrated view of their participation. For a summary of these statements;\nsee APPENDIX C.\n\nThree University research projects are on file in AID/Kenya.\nThese did not appear to be of the quality required for government use.",

Although no logframe is part of the project\ndocumentation, the following logframe elements are constructed from the available documentation:\n\n1. Goal: Improved rural development policies and programs.\nNo data were reviewed to estimate the contribution of ADC fellows\nto this goal.\n\n2. Purpose: To increase the competence of Asians to deal with the\neconomic and human problems of agricultural and rural development in\ntheir own countries. The ADC prepared biographical statements on a stratified sample of\n26 of the 51 fellows who have completed their training under the grant.\nAll the fellows were selected from university, government or other\ninstitutional positions where they had demonstrated the potential to make\na much more significant contribution in their fields if they could receive\nPh.D. training.

      "Key Findings": "Korean agriculture revolves around rice (Oryza sativa\nL.), and all other agricultural activities must accommodate them-\nselves to its production. An examination of Table 10 shows rice to\nbe the one crop in which both the researcher's and farmer's yield\ngoals have been achieved. Table 11 shows progress in getting earlier\nmaturing high yieling varieties (HYV's). In addition, very respect-\nable progress has been made in breeding for cold tolerance, disease\nresistance, insect resistance, saline tolerance and in the mechaniza-\ntion of rice cultivation. Because there are many new traits which\nneed to be incorporated into the Tongil plant type, continued examina-\ntion of realistic breeding priorities must be assessed. This is\nnecessary to assure stabilization of the dramatic increases of rice\nyields which have been made. The Interdisciplinary Rice Committee\n(IDRC) ;3hould be strengthened and encouraged to coordinate and\ndevelop the priorities by which the independent research programs\nat CES, Suweon; HES, Honam; and YES, Youngnam are thoroughly\ncomplementary in their thrust. The IDRC published a 135 page\n\"The Scope of Rice Production, Use and Research in Korea,\" report\nwhich outlines research and production constraints followed by\nIdentification and required fortification of research activities essential to the acceleration of the overall national rice research program.\nThis has been an excellent briefing document for all IDRC members,\nadministrators, consultants and other interested scientists.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "Improve the salaries of research personnel to make them\ncompetitive with those paid to university staff of comparable\nstatus. This should have the highest priority possible.\n\nRevise the personnel system of ORD to provide two parallel\nladders for advancement, one for active research workers and\nthe other for management. The system should provide for the\nadvancement of research workers to grades and salaries equal\nto those of management personnel.\n\nStart an all-out program for the training of research personnel\nin the use of the English language, beginning with people newly-\ninducted into the ORD Service.\n\nStart a crash program for the training of subject-matter special-\nists in plant pathology and entomology in order to alleviate\ncritical shortages in these specialities. Provide for wider\ncooperation at the project level between discipline and crop-\noriented scientists.\n\nProvide for a centralized biometrics unit which: (1) will supply\nadvice and assistance to all research workers on design, data\ncollection, and interpretation of the results of the experiments,\nand (2) will provide a computerized data analysis service.\n\n",

The major impacts of ACTI studies seen in this project were the results of studies under taken from one to three years prior to the start of the project. Each new study appears\nto gain impact due to the success of previous studies. Follow-up costs are very high - more than $100,000 in mailings alone each year. Perhaps most important is an entrepreneurial personality for the studies director resulting in extensive, non-formal efforts\nto diffuse the study information.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Under an expanded program, there would have to be a largex: BOSTID staff and, of critical importance to assure quality and credibility, more frequent meetings of the Board itself, coupled with a suitable executive committee or standing committee structure.\n\nIn a new project, there should be an improved financial management system so that personnel costs and indirect costs can be more easily tied to project functions and outputs.\n\nIn view of what may be increased difficulty in locating and attracting the uncompensated S&T experts who would be needed in an expanded program, NAS/BOSTID should consider a more formal system to identify and attract participants.\n\nNAS/BOSTID should intensify use of its newly-designed evaluation system, including increased follow-up visits to workshops and a survey of NRC reviews of ACTI monographs in order to identify measures which would improve quality.\n\nWe believe the NAS overseas grant and contracts management procedures are likely to require careful scrutiny if an expanded program involves subgrants or subcontracting.\n\nThe system of producing and reviewing ACTI reports requires attention so that there is a more rapid completion of reports.",

In another 7 projects the research was directed at\ncrops grown by small farmers. In two projects the traditional\nimplementing agency focus on larger or more privileged farmers\nhindered efforts at helping the poor majority.

For\nanother 11 projects the on-farm testing was either non-existent or\nexperienced serious problems. Difficulties with on-farm experi-\nmentation included logistical problems associated with inadequate\ntransportation and dispersion of numerous field sites, problems in\nmanaging farm trials, and the imbalance between on-farm research\nand that conducted on research stations.

Research will be undertaken through this Cooperative\nAgreement to help selected African institutions develop improved agroforestry technologies through the selection,\nimprovement and cultivation of mUltipurpose woody species for\nuse in agroforestry systems. The research will be\nimplemented through an intercountry collaborative research\nnetwork for which ICRAF will provide technical backstopping\nand coordination.\n3. As improved woody species are identified for each technology,\nICRAF, in cooperation with institutions from developing countries and other donor organizations, will help produce seeds/plant material to accelerate the dissemination of the\nimproved biological materials.\n4. The multidisciplinary nature of this research requires the\ncombined use of resources available in institutions from the\nagriculture and forestry sectors. Networking is the\nappropriate operational model to bring together these various\ndisciplines, given its flexible nature and potential for\nusing available resources in a complementary fashion. In\nnortheast Africa, the research capabilities of most\nforestry/agriculture institutions is minimal, and it is\nanticipated that research networking will result in\nstrengthening the capabilities of these institutions to do\nagroforestry research.\n",

      "Key Recommendations": "1. The move toward a cooperative model of development assistance is a positive\nstep.\n2. A previous relationship is important to the success of a partnership as trust has already been built and there is not a steep learning curve that has to be\novercome.\n3. Clear understanding of roles and responsibilities of each partner from the outset of a partnership contributes to success.\n4. Allow for considerable flexibility in implementation.\n5. Greater attention should be given to program impact through funded evaluation activities.\n6. Guidance to ministries of higher education for improved\ntertiary education in Africa must incorporate an understanding and appreciation of accreditation processes and provide for colleges and universities to work toward meeting accreditation requirements.\n7. Efforts to strengthen human and institutional capacity in African higher education must take private institutions into account as never before.",

      "Key Recommendations": "1.HESN Labs should streamline activities, adjust resource allocations, and increase synergies based on the insights gained through the first five years.\n2. USAID should extend funding to HESN Labs needed for core critical operating functions and costs, and should maintain the capacity for Missions and other operating units to use buy-ins to facilitate partnerships with HESN Labs.\n3. USAID and HESN Labs should work together to hone an effective strategy for creating partnerships with USAID Missions.\n4. USAID should centralize (or contract to centralize) the dissemination of research and policy briefs, academic publications, and other knowledge products produced by HESN Labs for better access by the broader academic and development community.\n5.  Each Lab should create an ongoing partnership with one or more strategically-located developing country HEIs to access in-country researchers, communities, and innovators who can identify critical challenges and contextual needs and support capacity for research and innovation in HEI partners.\n6. USAID should reduce the number of indicators required for reporting and allow individual HESN Labs to use a focused set of indicators that correspond to a core set of value propositions.\n7. HESN should explore linkages with related USG efforts to share knowledge and increase understanding of the overlaps between university research and technology entrepreneurship.\n8. USAID and HESN Labs should develop a strategy, such as conferences and/or communities of practice, to engage development innovation stakeholders outside of HESN in directions both synergistic and complementary with the current set of research areas and value propositions.",

      "Key Recommendations": "- Create an online module of the STIP Integration training to make it easily accessible for Missions\naround the world. Because some Mission staff are not clear about the different components of\nSTIP and how they can incorporate these in their work, the Lab should also request Missions’\n- Front Offices to make the STIP integration course compulsory for all staff.\n- Solicit feedback from Mission staff regarding additional specific STIP knowledge gaps. Specifically,\nthe STIP Advisor/Fellow and relationship managers (RMs) could help gather feedback across\nboth Missions. This information could help inform relevant Lab staff responsible for developing\nMission-specific trainings so that topics highest in demand are addressed.\n- Examine where GIS expertise might be needed in the Missions to provide additional support\ngiven the high demand for this type of service.\n-Conduct a strategic review to examine the extent to which its services and resources align with\nthe strategies of the Missions.",

      "Key Findings": "In its first two years, the Russian Civil Society Support Program “Dialogue” has made significant contributions to grass-roots and community-based activists’ efforts to form associations capable of lobbying local and regional governments for more responsive social policy. Over thirty local and regional NGO associations and advocacy groups, with a total of 840 constituent organizations, have been created to represent citizen interests in the areas of health care, education, women’s rights, environmental protection, housing, government transparency, and rights of people with disabilities. With CSSP support, advocacy NGOs across the country have commissioned twenty practical research studies to provide evidence for informed and professional policy making at the municipal and regional level. Exploiting the inadequacy of government structures to address urgent policy needs, CSSP advocacy funding has allowed grantees to conduct over 363 advocacy campaigns addressing ninety-three distinct legislative and normative acts at the local, regional, and federal levels.\n\nDespite the notable successes, CSSP has suffered its share of confusion and re-structuring due to both internal and external events.\n\nUnlike the first year of CSSP, investment in social policy development in the second year of the program provided a great deal of information regarding both the potential for evidence-based advocacy as well how best to structure it into the larger CSSP design.",

      "Document Title": "Kosovo American Education Fund (KAEF) Evaluation",
      "Key Findings": "KAEF is a success with respect to its Fellows program. As a conventional non-institutional\ndevelopment participant training program, KAEF has done very well. With its 100 percent success rate\nat U.S. universities and relatively high return rate, many other programs would be envious of its\naccomplishments. There is also every indication that KAEF Fellows who have returned are making a\ndifference in their firms and institutions, and the KAEF name is becoming increasingly known in Kosovo\nas a symbol of excellence. This is an impressive list of accomplishments. Those at AC who worked on\nKAEF and the Fellows who benefited from it should feel proud of their accomplishments.\nKAEF has not done as expected financially, and it will cease to exist if current financial trends\ncontinue. Whether justified or not, USAID and AC had higher expectations – that KAEF’s endowment would be “perpetual” and allow the program to continue indefinitely. From that perspective, the record is troubling. Although AC went outside to hire talent to conduct the asset management and fundraising\nfunctions in a professional manner, the latter has clearly not had the success expected. As a result,\ndespite AC’s quite successful efforts to curtail costs, the program has run large deficits that had to be\ncovered by drawing down the endowment, leaving the sustainability of KAEF over the long-term\nuncertain.",
      "Key Recommendations": "- Increasing Kosovar involvement in decision-making and in fundraising. The returned Fellows and the Kosovar members of the Board are too valuable a resource to waste. They could be contributing more, and they would surely welcome the opportunity. The involvement of graduates and Board members seems particularly appropriate in doing fundraising with\nKosovar businesses – the most fruitful source of donations to date.\n\n- Reviewing options to increase the development impact. KAEF is oriented toward selecting the candidate most likely to succeed in a U.S. master’s degree program regardless of the\napplicant’s proposed field of study, provided it is in within the eligible fields. Implicitly, it assumes that all master’s degrees within the eligible fields are equal in value. Moreover, not all master’s degrees – not even all degrees in the currently accepted fields -- necessarily have the same\ndevelopment impact. USAID and AC may thus wish to increase the development criteria or emphasis in selection vis-à-vis the academic performance criteria. Substituting some development professionals for admissions officers might bring that shift about. Consideration could be given, as well, to giving preference from time-to-time to one discipline over another or to the development of a critical institution.\n\n- Address the participation of women and minorities. KAEF is oriented toward selecting the candidate most likely to succeed in a U.S. master’s degree program regardless of gender or ethnic group, and its founding documents specify that gender equality is a goal of AC. However, the approach to application and selection appears to have been blind to the effects of gender roles on women’s participation and the vulnerability of minority groups. A combination of methods would be needed to address the situation. For example, one piece could be implementing a gender- and culturally sensitive recruitment effort aimed at women and minorities. Additionally, identifying and addressing bias in application and selection processes could increase equity. Despite the higher number of women enrolled in tertiary education, equal\nparticipation of women in the fellowship is unlikely to be achieved unless some effort of this kind is instituted.\n\n- Improving analysis and reporting. The evaluation team recommends that AC develop a substantially more comprehensive format for its annual reports. Those reports should not just\nsummarize the previous year but explain how the previous year’s activities fit with or change\nwhat happened in previous years. Reports should identify trends with respect to the sex, ethnicity and fields of Fellows; their test scores; their performance; their participation in\ninternships and Practical Training and their experiences upon returning home. Decisions of the Board and significant decisions of AC staff about the project should be noted and the reasons\nfor them explained. The results of internal evaluations of KAEF processes should be summarized along with steps, if any, that AC plans to take to make improvements. The finances of the project should not only be presented, they should be analyzed. Significant deviations from the\nprevious annual budget plan should be explained fully. Data should be presented in easy to read tables with accompanying explanation of trends, issues, successes and failures, etc. Similarly, the report should show revenues and expenditures for the entire period; changes in the\nendowment, trends and problems.\n\n- Convincing more Fellows to return to Kosovo. As noted in Section IV above, the evaluation team did not have the opportunity to review what actions AC had taken to encourage the return to Kosovo of the six Fellows who never returned or the two who returned and then left. As these cases reduce the KAEF’s impact, the evaluation team suggests that AC and USAID review these cases and consider whether additional action is warranted.\n\n- Find ways to strengthen linkages. Although many Fellows reported that they have maintained contact with at least one individual at their host universities, the evaluation team’s experience in other countries suggests that such ties are often fragile and do not last. Yet, such ties can encourage a flow of technical information and mutual understanding useful to both countries. This is presumably why the development of linkages were mentioned in the original KAEF agreement as a desired outcome. To enhance the development of linkages, the evaluation team recommends that AC seek ways to encourage activities in Kosovo that would strengthen linkages between the Fellows and their host U.S. universities and among the Fellows themselves.\n\nThe Fellows themselves are probably the best source of ideas about how this might be done. A small amount of money, perhaps matched by contributions from the Fellows, their employers or the U.S. universities might go a long way to build lasting linkages.",

      "Key Findings": "An overall assessment of progress against indicators suggests that output indicator targets are\ngenerally likely to be met. There is no strong evidence to suggest that levels of effort and resources are\nnot appropriately matched to the achievement of output targets. Impact and outcome targets in key\nareas of finance, employment and business development are less likely to be achieved (when such\ntargets have been specified). This may be due to factors beyond the manageable interest of the FTF\nprogram, but it may also reflect the diffuse nature of market‐based interventions and the limited\ncoordination between such projects. The achievement of objective‐level impact targets is more\nproblematic still. While it is possible that there may be significant improvement in indicators to the\ntargeted levels and beyond, it is unlikely that any of these targets will be met as a result of program\ninterventions alone.\n\nThe USAID Ethiopia DO1 and FTF development strategies have not been completely aligned and as a\nresult, the causal pathway linking project interventions to the FTF objectives and goal is not always\nrobust. \n\nThe introduction of a coordinated interdepartmental FTF program should have been undertaken in parallel with the introduction of a dedicated portfolio management system. This did not occur and as a\nresult, the capacity of management to achieve the necessary oversight and to respond in the event of\nunforeseen developments has been compromised. \n\nThe value of reported data for FTF program management is compromised by a number of factors. There are no PMP targets for a number of FTF indicators, which limits the usefulness of such indicators and\nprevents direct assessment of the extent to which available resources are adequate to meet program\nobjectives. Some indicators aggregate data from sources that do not bear strict comparison, while\nothers are subject to varying interpretations by different projects. Still others may be incorrectly\nentered into the FTFMS.\n\nAlthough there is a consistent gender component throughout FTF and despite the fact that all data was\ngender disaggregated, it was not always evident that the gender concerns were fully addressed. In some cases, when indicators showed female participation in activities to be lower than planned, project teams\ndid not appear to have reflected on why this had occurred, and whether the activities they were\npromoting met female needs.\n\nAs one of the largest FTF portfolios globally, FTF Ethiopia is in a unique position to provide lessons\nlearned not only for future USAID Ethiopia projects, but to inform FTF more broadly. Currently neither\nthe knowledge management components of projects, nor efforts at the Mission, are sufficient to capture\nthese experiences and share them.\n\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "This perspective strongly suggests that a long‐term layered approach to the challenges of FTF, in which direct interventions with beneficiaries are undertaken in conjunction with more systemic market development initiatives might provide a more robust solution than has been seen to date. Such an approach would also include a direct nutritional component that addressed each of the eight different\nfactors affecting child nutrition (and especially stunting). An opportunity now exists through the introduction of PSNP4 to build upon both the successes and lessons learned to date, through the implementation of a model similar to GRAD that could influence national policy through example. Such a program would include both highland and pastoral coverage, with tailored programming to the sociocultural,\neconomic and environmental realities of different regions. Title II FFP funding would provide the foundation to ensure asset maintenance and food security, while layered on top of this would be a series of projects funded by FTF including:\n Household‐level interventions to strengthen production and income\n- An integrated approach to nutrition, incorporating response to all the various facets of the\nstunting syndrome\n- Demand‐driven market facilitation interventions targeting both the poor as well as others\nnecessary to ensure the viability of value chains\n- Policy and enabling environment support, as well as technical assistance for key government\ninstitutions.",

      "Document ID": "1509-Mille-LBN",
      "Document Title": "USAID Lebanon University Scholarship Program Mid-Term Evaluation",
      "Key Findings": "National Coverage\n-Outreach: The three universities succeeded in achieving broad national outreach. Students were recruited from all of Lebanon’s 26 districts, with select underrepresentation in some programs from specific remote areas (Annex 4.B –Distribution of USP enrolled Students by districts and by USP). Visits by university staff to the districts and high school principals were instrumental in spreading knowledge about USP to the successful applicants. USP student enrollment is gender balanced at AUB, female biased at LAU and was even further female biased at HU. Overall, USP students have a similar gender distribution as that of public high school students.\n-Meeting Criteria: The findings support the conclusion that the applicants who are accepted into USP meet the criteria of high academic achievement and financial need for scholarship awards.\n-Enrolled Cohorts Diverse and Nationally Distributed: The student cohort is nationally geographically distributed with some underrepresentation of some remote districts, and contains a majority (60%) of female students.\n-Impediments to Recruitment in Any Areas: Impediments appear to include: lack of community knowledge about USP in the communities that have supplied few students for the program, and the small schools with lower number of students to select from in some remote areas. Fieldwork was not done in areas regularly supplying students, which would have been a valuable comparison. A similar study was deemed unnecessary because the team expected such information to be available in FGDs, Survey Monkey data, and the USAID Survey of Graduates.\n\nScholars Overall Performance:\n-Performance: Program managers report USP students are among their best performers academically. USP students also perceive themselves as doing well in the program. Graduates achieved high Grade Point Average (GPAs around 3.3 over 4), and the majority of computer science students on the Dean’s Honor List at LAU are USP students. LAU reports 56% of USP students have GPAs above 3.2, compared to 29% of non-USP students. The Office of Institutional Research and Assessment (OIRA) at the AUB ran an analysis over a random sample of 15 students comparing their academic performance and ranking in a total of 30 exams (2 exams/student). The results showed that USP students scored higher than the average of the non-USP counterparts in 27/30 exams (90%). In 20/30 exams, the USP students were ranked among the first five of their classes (class size average ± stdev = 30±17 students).\n-Integration/Abuse, Disrespect: Students report some initial issues with their integration into the university community, but these tended to decrease in time. However, concerns were expressed by AUB students that USP dormitory students are being moved to another dorm where they will be segregated. FGD participants at one of the universities reported several instances of what they interpreted as disrespectful treatment by university appointed program managers, and indeed reported an undercurrent of substantial tension between USP program managers and USP students. Much more positive relationships between program managers and students were reported by FGD participants at the other two universities who were reported by USP students to be more encouraging and responsive. Another important issue was raised by a dropped student who was advised to seek counseling and testing at the counseling center. The student reported that the counseling center was not set up to maintain auditory privacy and, without his/her permission, shared his/her confidential information with faculty, staff and the student’s parents.\n-Active Student Leadership: The USP program encouraged, supported and mandated an educational program that emphasized community and campus involvement, and leadership training and experience. USP achieved active student leadership among many USP students. It is uncertain whether graduates will assume active community and professional leadership positions in the future although they are optimistic on this subject.\n-Preparation for Entry into the Labor Market: Almost all (94%) of the respondents to the online survey are planning to enter the labor market at some time in the future. Workshops were organized by the universities to prepare the students to be successful at jobs interviews (for example, AUB held a Blom Bank Curriculum Vitae (CV) Writing and Interview Skills lecture for USP II students. Haigazian held an Interview Boot Camp Training and workshops on career skills; provided one-to-one support to students on writing a CV, cover letter and interview; and provided support in job searches). The Career Guidance Office at LAU has held a number of activities and workshops (e.g. the Communication Skills Workshop, which was aimed at engaging USP scholars in exploring their career paths and enhancing their communications skills to improve both personal and professional aspects of their lives).\n-The vast majority (90%) of students reported wanting to obtain graduate education either immediately after graduation or after they gain a few years of employment. However, a minority of graduates (22%) have found employment quickly (within three months).\n\nProgrammatic Performance:\n-Achievement of Planned Outputs and Outcomes: Appropriate outputs and outcomes are poorly defined in program documents supplied by USAID; however, the graduation rate is on track with 3.5% (17/496) dropout rate by the date August 2015. Higher level outcomes will require longer term evaluation.\n-Achievement of Value for Money: While “value for investment” is difficult to assess, especially in the short-term, and where outcomes are not well articulated, all stakeholders interviewed in KIIs enthusiastically expressed the view that USP provides value for USAID’s investment by bringing transformational change in the life of individuals, families and communities. Moreover, USAID has been supporting the Lebanese public school system with more than $100M of funds invested since 2006 in the public primary education sector. While offering those same public high school students scholarships that allow them to obtain a quality higher education and thus maximizing their potential to support Lebanon’s democratic and economic development, the USP program complements the efforts and leverages the funds invested in the primary education\n\nSustainability\n-Prospects: USP is likely not sustainable as a whole because the universities afford to financially support the program, but many of its program features including workshops, community involvement, leadership training, capstone projects, etc. are recognized by university staff as adding value for all students, and could strengthen the overall universities’ educational programs if the staff is motivated and finds resources to support these activities. Additionally, the alumnae program may add sustainable components into the future by keeping lines of communication and influence open with USP graduates.\n\nMechanism\n-Cost and Management Burden: The present system of separate contracts for each USP places a substantial increase on the management burden on USAID and the implementing partners by requiring separate reports from the universities for each USP.\nComparison to MEPI\n-Potentially Useful MEPI Components for USP: MEPI differs from USP in that it sends students abroad for short-term training and brings regional students to Lebanon. However two components of MEPI may prove useful to USP: encouraging continuing contact with civic engagement in the home area; and providing an intensive group training for all MEPI scholars. USP has a lower cost per student than MEPI. A higher percentage of the USP budget is allocated for educational and student support costs.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Expand Outreach: Continue and expand outreach visits to all public high schools with a special focus on areas which have been under-represented. Expand these visits to provide an orientation about the program to the community. Consider encouraging student and graduate involvement in the outreach program.\n2. Ensure that the Management Style of all USP University Implementers Reflect USP Program Values: USAID staff should ensure that USP Implementing Partners address and adhere to compliance concerns in order to effectively respond to all student issues of concern including respect, abuse, rigidity, confidentiality and other issues. University managers should ensure that, to the extent possible, their own management styles reflect USP values including: democratic participation in decision-making; negotiated settlements of outstanding issues; absolute confidentiality during counseling regarding student problems, issues and personality tests; and integration of USP students into all aspects of University life, including common spaces such as dormitories.\n3. Prevent Dropouts: USAID should review its policy on the possibility of granting a semester’s break to students in good academic standing who experience a serious psychological or physical health problem rather than dropping them from the program.\n4. Provide More Help in Selection of Majors: Recognizing the importance of the selection of a major to the entire university educational experience, universities should provide more information and assistance regarding the implications of choosing different majors in securing an employment, and strive to empower students to make an informed decision among a substantial number of choices. USP staff and faculty should take further steps to encourage students to avoid gender stereotyping in the selection of their majors, while still allowing students considerable freedom to choose.",

      "Document Title": "University Scholarship Program II Final Report",
      "Key Findings": "Academically, the overall outcome of the USP II program is an unambiguous success. Out of the 50 selected students, 37 (74%) graduated with a cumulative GPA of 80 and above and only two did not graduate within the time frame of the program. Many scholars, roughly 40% per semester, were placed on Dean’s Honor lists. Four scholars graduated with high distinction and 15 others with distinction. Five scholars received special awards for their excellent achievements.\n\nAll scholars completed the internship component of the program, 24 as professional and civic supplemental (major-related) internships and 26 as non-major internships.\n\nWith respect to the Civic Engagement and Leadership component, all USP II scholars actively attended a variety of workshops, including Leadership Training and Social Media Training Workshops. They all participated regularly in volunteering activities, clubs, and societies. They took part in several field trips. They completed 10 Community Service Projects successfully. For only one of them, the final implementing phase is still pending.\n\nThe number of beneficiaries of these CSPs amounted to about 1000 in their respective communities.\nThe final Performance Monitoring Plan (PMP) indicates equal to or higher achievements than most baseline indicators and Life of Project (LOP) targets, with the exception of a drop noticed in participating in volunteering activities and field trips in the students’ graduation years.\n\nImpact on Students and Families: The general outcome of the award is highly satisfactory. Forty eight scholars (96%) graduated within the time frame of the award. A large number of scholars, roughly 40% per semester, were placed on the Dean’s Honors Lists. Four scholars graduated with high distinction and 15 with distinction. Five scholars received various awards on their excellent achievements. A significant growth on the academic and personal levels was observed in the CAAP tests and COS survey results.\n\nGeneral Impact on AUB: With the continuously increasing university fees, AUB risks catering only to the financial elite. The USP awards presented a golden opportunity to underserved communities to get a quality tertiary education, thus giving AUB a social dimension and role. AUB instructors are now dealing with new cohort profiles, generally more motivated and hardworking. AUB staff now has to develop new infrastructures and allocate new resources to accommodate the new given. Furthermore, the civic engagement component, set as a requirement for USP scholars, is now being considered to be a requirement for all AUB students.\n\nImpact on the Community: Firstly, the award represents a pathway to high quality education for deserving public school students. Secondly, with its civic component, the award is bringing into the various communities expertise and values. The projects implemented in the different regions represent the short term/direct impact – the number of beneficiaries from the CSP projects amounted to 1000. Graduating students working in their communities represent the long term impact. More importantly the award is bringing into those communities the AUB values of tolerance, freedom of thought and expression, respect for diversity and dialogue, and civic responsibility.

      "Document Title": "Cacao for Peace Colombia: Concept for Development and Implementation of a Strategy for Supporting Collaborative Research on Cacao in Colombia",
      "Key Findings": "Although currently there is a strong effort to develop and coordinate this sector, it suffers from a lack of investment and insufficient coordination between stakeholders. The result is a lack of communication and coordination between the various stakeholders which in turn limits the impact of the efforts underway. Consequence of this is that the cacao research community in Colombia is fragmented and cannot adequately support the needs of the cacao sector in Colombia especially in the context of the national goals for expansion.\nDeveloping a strategy for sustaining successful long-term funding from national and international sources for cacao research will greatly depend upon building of solid research foundation including creating and supporting strong research networks, publishing high-quality basic and applied research manuscripts, building a critical mass in key areas, PhD training, establishment of international and national reputation, and attracting the best academic researchers in Colombia and internationally. This could be achieved by first increasing coordination among the main governing and funding agencies in-country and the research institutions. Such a coordination will be best developed by creating a multi-institutional platform for collaboration in cacao research for Colombia that will require participation of national and international organizations.",
      "Key Recommendations": "The consensus priority research areas for immediate research focus are: market analysis of fine vs bulk cacaos, increased farm productivity and social science research such as farmer technology adoption, association creation and extension strategies. The analysis has resulted in the identification of a set of cross-cutting high priority activities detailed in Table 1-13.\n\nColombia should increase its R&D investment. Public investment in science, technology and innovation for the agricultural sector in Colombia is 0.08% of national GDP and 1.16% of agricultural GDP, far from levels required to support effective growth in the agricultural sector.\n\nDonor community is diverse and underutilized. There are multiple national and international programs which can fund cacao research, however a more systematic effort needs to be applied to develop partnerships with potential donor agencies.\n\nThe research community is diverse, decentralized and uncoordinated. Efforts should be made to promote interdisciplinary collaboration between various research entities to increase the competitiveness of the cacao research community to take advantage of available opportunities.\n\nProposed first step is to create a permanent international working group for cacao research for Colombia (CRC). The group will be charged with continuously identifying strategic research needs and resource gaps, identifying opportunities for agency coordination, cooperation, public-private and international partnerships, and opportunities to enhance training, education and agricultural extension through the engagement of stakeholder in the cacao sector and communities.\n\nConsidering the similarity in the needs and the priorities described in the first to chapters of this document we propose that the successful model of IWGPG be adopted and modified to suit the needs of the cacao research sector in Colombia. We proposed the establishment of a permanent Interagency Working Group on Cacao Research for Colombia (CRC) that would be convened and funded to develop a comprehensive and long-term plan to implement a coordinated framework for cacao research and development in Colombia with the following main goals:\n1. Development of 5-year, 10-year and future vision plans with specific research priorities and global needs assessment to consolidate and integrate the many prior assessments.\n2. Work with the existing national and international structure reviewed above to develop coordinated funding nodes and specific programs at each level of the cacao value chain for research to reduce redundancy, increase focus on priority topics and foster interdisciplinary research.\n\n3. Development of a coordinated framework for funding the nodes to consolidate funding to fewer, larger programs with coordinated priority areas.\n\n4. Development of standardized system for research proposal evaluation (peer review system) to increase the quality and impact of funded research programs and involve more scientists in the community.\n\n5. Development of coordinated program for capacity building to be implemented within the research programs to increase scientific capacity and train next generation of scientists.\n\n6. Build the competitiveness the Colombian cacao research community to compete for national and international research funding by:\na. Building a sustainable research network supported by network manager and knowledge sharing platform.\nb. Providing the members of the network with access to information related to advances in research in the field of cacao research and in general.\nc. Providing the members of the network information with a database with members information useful for connecting with potential partners.\nd. Providing the members of the network on a regular base with information related to new funding opportunities\ne. Providing the members of the network with guidance and support for preparation of grant proposals including consultation, resources and training to build teams, and technical guidance for timely proposal writing and according to guidelines.\nf. Develop community tools and resources that will accelerate cacao research, such as genetic databases, communication tools etc.",

      "Key Findings": "Collaboration between entities is fundamental for grassroots organizations to achieve their mission. In this paper we presented two instances of how these collaborations can unfold. Our goal is to provide insight into what advantages and challenges engaging in multilateral partnerships may bring for these initiatives, and most importantly, for grassroots organizations leading these efforts. From our perspective, generating a flexible framework for negotiating and aligning objectives, making sure that principles and philosophies across partners are compatible and acknowledging the limitations some partners may have due to political or organizational factors, are key aspects to the design of these alliances. Having a structure for measuring impact that is shared among all organizations can help understand in detail how these partnerships add value or disrupt the achievement of each partner’s mission. Expanding the Theory of Change framework to include input from all organizations is a logical step. Recently, numerous groups working in the field of International Development are using this strategy with promising results (Vogel, 2012). Partnerships also provide a unique opportunity to shift structures and systems by exposing stakeholders to new approaches, methodologies and philosophies of work. The fact that each organization brings to the table networks, knowledge and resources, represents an advantage when trying to capitalize these opportunities. We hope to demonstrate that, if carefully crafted, these kind of partnerships can be powerful tools for achievement and change across partners objectives and systems.",

      "Key Findings": "Most of the farmers interviewed are small-scale (owning up to 1 hectare of land) female farmers that\ndepend on rain-fed and flooding irrigation techniques. The service had an impact over water usage [sic],\ncrops, yields and farmers’ income through information provided by drone operators, which were of\ntwo types: (i) problem location, meaning they they [sic] were informed of where a certain problem was\noccuring [sic] in their farms (crop stress, soil salinity, flooding, clogged water channels) and (ii) advice on\nfarming practices: they were advised on farming techniques and skills, either confirming or improving\ntheir knowledge of farming. 40% of the farmers (N=55) received the first type of information, 36% of\nthe farmers received the second type and 24% received both types of information.\n\n77% of the respondents (N=60) felt that there was some kind of (direct/indirect) benefit from the\ninformation they received while using the service and all leaders of association thought that the\ninnovation made their work easier for different reasons. Even though it was not possible to quantify\nchanges in water usage, the innovation is seen as having a positive indirect impact over water efficiency [sic] in some areas by serving as encouragement for farmers to clean water channels or by providing the necessary justification to have fields leveled. As the innovation also provided advice on farming practices it can also indirectly have led to better use of water and other resources in farming.\n\nWhen it comes to benefits to crops, even though 60% of farmers increased their yields over the period\nexamined, other factors besides the innovation were identified by farmers as also having an impact\nover production [sic].",
      "Key Recommendations": "When it comes to farmers’ perceived benefits from innovation, the type of information deemed as most beneficial to farmers was not the main scope of the innovation (identifying in advance where problems were occuring [sic]), but rather advice on farming practices. 56% of respondents (N=34) said that the service would be more effective if it not only identified where problems were located in the farms but also provided means to solve these problems, mostly fertilizers and pesticides. The second most common suggestion was that the innovation should provide farmers with more advice on farming practices.\n\nThis report also discussed to what extent the innovation’s main purpose (to inform farmers in advance\nabout the location of problems in their farms) was actually occurring considering drone operators’\nworking schedule and the total number of users, and how beneficial can the innovation be to farmers\nwho own, in [sic] average, not more than 1 hectare of land and cannot afford much [sic] farming inputs. In fact, data shows that farmers who owned smaller farms or that were classified in the poorest income\ngroups were the ones that less perceived benefits from innovation. And data also showed that\ninnovation had very little impact on poverty reduction when looking at the entire sample.\n\nWhen asked if they would like the service to continue, 66% (N= 62) of the farmers said yes, while the\nrest was not sure or not interested in continuing with the service.",

      "Key Findings": "• Findings suggest that the agribusiness support model is more likely to be sustainable for businesses with high growth potential.\n• A majority of RADP supported businesses demonstrated some level of ability to change and adapt during the project period. Businesses that were able to adapt to changing conditions are more likely to be sustainable.\n• Issues stemming from the external environment pose risks to businesses’ future growth and sustainability.\n• Limited access to finance limits businesses’ ability to grow and negatively affects sustainability.\n• Organizational changes made from RADP assistance are likely to be sustained, although changes that were dependent on RADP non-durable in-kind support or grant assistance may not be sustained after the project.\n\n• RADP is likely to achieve its results related to outcomes on increased agriculture sector productivity and profitability, agribusiness profitability, and women’s participation in agriculture value-chain activities.\n• About half of supported agribusinesses are likely to be more responsive to market demand due to increased market linkages and improvements in business capacity and operations.\n• Farmers supported by the program largely reported adopting improved practices resulting in increased yields and incomes. However, results related to improved market linkages for farmers are less likely to be met.\n• Although not an explicit program objective, the RADP training and agribusiness support models had mixed results on changes in illicit crop production, particularly in the North.\n\n• Women were relatively well integrated into RADP training interventions, particularly considering the cultural context in rural Afghanistan. However, women were not well involved in agribusiness interventions due to cultural and material barriers that limit female entrepreneurship. RADPs in regions with greater gender equality (e.g., the North), were able to increase female participation in agribusiness interventions.\n• Youth were not explicitly targeted by RADP in general. However, implementing partners used opportunities to engage youth in a targeted manner.\n\n• RADP’s regional approach was fairly effective at improving household food security and income. However, RADP’s regional approach was less effective at shifting production from illicit to licit crops.\n• Evidence did not exist to confirm that the regional approach was effective at fostering broader market systems development, in part due to limitations in M&E data.\n\n• Some institutional and informational structures are likely to be sustained after RADP ends, such as agribusiness organizational changes and improved farmer capacity. However, the degree to which interventions were institutionalized and whether business and farmer improvements will sustain without support is an open question.\n\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "The ET provides recommendations below based on findings for each EQ and the type of support beneficiaries reported they would like from future programs. We provide recommendations for RADP-East and future programs. However, we do not provide recommendations for RADP-North because it is in its last year of implementation.\n\nEQ1: Is the agribusiness support model likely to be sustainable?\n\n•Because we found that some businesses were constrained by lack of access to finance, which we conclude will negatively affect the model’s sustainability, we recommend RADP-East and future programs connect businesses with sources of finance and build their capacity to obtain loans successfully.\n•Future programs should continue to provide a mix of technical assistance and in-kind support to help businesses both improve capacity and production quality and efficiency.\n\nEQ2: Is the training model design and implementation effective in contributing to beneficiary adoption of improved agricultural technologies and licit crops?\n\nFuture programs and RADP-East should:\n•Strengthen and monitor quality of beneficiary selection so that training is provided to beneficiaries for who it will have the most value; ensuring that beneficiaries are farmers who engage in the targeted value chains will increase their likelihood of adopting new technologies and licit crops.\n•Further tailor the content of training to address the key constraints faced by farmers in different regions and to ensure that techniques and technologies promoted are accessible and feasible for farmers to implement. Improved practices and new crops need to be profitable for farmers to incentivize and sustain adoption.\n•In drought-prone areas, provide more training to farmers and provide demonstrations on water conservation technologies and the production of drought resistant crops. Farmers may be more likely to take up new technologies that do not have high water needs in areas where access to water is limited.\n•Include more market related training modules to male and female farmers to build their skills on how to access markets for relevant crops and livestock products, build relationships with buyers, negotiate with buyers, and access market information (e.g., on prices, demand, quality requirements). Provide training to farmers that includes practical demonstrations and training at demonstration plots to improve the effectiveness of training on farmer learning and skill building.\n\nEQ3: Based on the implementation approach, status of implementation, and milestones achieved at the time of mid-term evaluation, is there evidence that the program is likely to achieve its results by the end date?\n\nFuture programs and RADP-East should:\n•Strengthen efforts to help farmers access markets for high value crops by facilitating direct linkages between farmers and buyers to help increase farmers’ revenue from licit crops, because farmers may increase adoption licit crops if they can provide an economic substitute for poppy.\n•Strengthen agribusiness capacity to create direct linkages with farmers and to provide extension services to farmers to improve quality of production to improve farmer sales and agribusiness profits.\n\nEQ4: To what extent have women and youth been integrated into the implementation of RADP, and to what extent do women and youth respectively contribute to program goals?\n\n•RADP-East should encourage their agribusiness grantees to provide female-only trainings to improve the accessibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of training for women.\n•Future programs and RADP-East should work with women to obtain financial assistance with the backing of male relatives if necessary, to improve their ability to start and grow businesses.\n•Future programs should tailor agribusiness support interventions to small women-owned enterprises and develop criteria for grants that are possible for female entrepreneurs and women-owned businesses to meet. RADP-East should continue to evaluate its grant criteria to maximize participation by women-owned businesses.\n\nEQ5: Is the regional approach to the RADP programming likely most effective for achieving program goals? For example, how might a regional approach compare to a commodity-specific approach?\n\n•Future programs should choose whether to use a regional approach or a commodity-specific approach based on specific, core goals of the program.\n•In line with SIGAR recommendations (2018), RADP should harmonize M&E systems across projects where applicable to facilitate performance monitoring and assessment if it continues to operate as a regional program.\n\nEQ6: To what extent will institutional and informational structures be sustainable after project implementation?\n\n•Future programs and RADP-East should, increase coordination and collaboration with government to increase stakeholder buy-in and alignment with government policies and priorities to improve sustainability.",

      "Document Title": "SREU’s Multidisciplinary Research Support and Coordination Center: Concept Note and Implementation Plan",
      "Key Findings": "The overall objective of MRSCC is to promote a supporting institutional research environment at SREU which develops individual and institutional research capacities leading SREU to become a self-sustaining educational research institution in Afghanistan. Other objectives of the MRSCC are:\n• To generate creative research solutions in the low-resource settings\n• To promote culture of coordination and collaboration in research development\n• To expand research linkages with other interested partners beyond the boundaries of SREU\n\nMRSCC Guiding Principles\nThe implementation of MRSCC is based on the following guiding principles:\nThe SREU’s Low-resource Context - The MRSCC is developed with notion that research is an expensive undertaking and that SREU can’t expect to receive substantial funding either from government or donor agencies. SREU commits itself to focus on utilizing its available resources to develop research capacities. The SREU over the past 15 years have received substantial support from donor agencies that has helped SRUE to establish various resource centers, computer labs, inter-departmental libraries, science labs, teaching and learning materials, virtual technology equipment, career center, language lab and others. In addition, the 280-faculty staff provide strong human capital which SREU understands can be the backbone for the development of research capacities. The SREU leadership would like to use available resources within the university, and at the same it will seek external support by establishing sponsorships, partnerships, service delivery linkages with local industries, donor agencies, government ministries, and individual entrepreneurs.\nMultidisciplinary – The SREU understands that separate research centers can’t be established at the 9 existing Faculties and the 34 Departments considering the low-resource context of higher education in Afghanistan. Therefore, the MRSCC is defined as an institutional-wide support and coordination entity,\nthe effectiveness of which rely on the multidisciplinary coordination and collaboration of various actors (leadership, deans, faculty, students, administrative staff) for the research development.\nCollaboration –the SREU leadership recognize the need for a collaborative organizational environment that is capable of fostering an institutional climate for sharing of knowledge and resources, peer-learning, and one-to-one support, etc… The various faculties and departments work in isolation; the linkages exist in more routine functions of attending meetings those are held as part of structural obligations. Hence a strong human capital of 280 faculty and 6,800 students remain dormant and passive in any sort of development efforts including research. The traditional approach to research in the form of academic rank promotions continue to dominate the SREU’s research undertakings. There is a decent number of faculty who have recently earned their PhDs and master degrees from reputable universities from Asian, European countries as well as from the United States. The MRSCC through the guiding principle of collaboration would like to mobilize the available significant human capital by assigning various research support functions to them.\n\nThe Functions of SREU Multidisciplinary Research Support and Coordination Center (MRSCC)\nThe MRSCC has the following three key functions:\n1. Research Support\n2. Research Business Development\n3. Research Management\n1. The research ‘Support’ Function of the MRSCC focuses on the support mechanisms those will focus on developing research capacity in faculty and students. The support function has three sub-functions of capacity development, coordination, communication and dissemination.\n1.1 Capacity Development (CD) – this sub function focuses on developing research capacity at individual (teachers and students) and institutional levels (departments and faculties). The CD efforts will be undertaken through short-training sessions, discussion forums, mini-workshops on various research topics, arranging and visiting research events, etc... The function will be carried out by the Research Capacity Development Coordinator (RCDC) who will be appointed by the SREU leadership. This is a non-Tashkeel position which will be rotated by the existing qualified faculty to fulfil their non-teaching responsibilities. The higher education law mandates faculty to undertake responsibilities assigned by the university leadership other than teaching. The CD support function will mobilize the expert level faculty to provide capacity development support to junior faculty through open training sessions, discussions, and one-to-one support. The CD function will also attract support of external entities in terms of inviting national and international guest speakers, education experts, development practitioners to share their perceptive and experiences on the research to SREU faculty and students (the Implementation Plan has the details).\n1.2 Coordination – the research coordination culture at SREU is very weak. The Coordination support function will coordinate SREU’s research efforts under one roof. The function will be carried out by the Research Coordinator (RC) who will be appointed by SREU leadership. The RC will develop a basic database by getting assistance from the IT department of SREU. The database will be used for research coordination purposes which will include the names, contact information of all SREU faculty, interested students, brief information of faculty expertise, etc… The RC will maintain a monthly research-event-tracker which will be send to faculty and interested students. The RC will also keep list of research topics\nundertaken by faculty and students, articles published, thesis written and regularly share them with entire faculty and students through email distribution list.\n1.3 Communication and Dissemination – the purpose of this support function is to create demand for research, provide research visibility to internal and external audience, showcase SREU’s research capabilities for possible sponsorships, partnerships and income-generating activities. The function will be carried out by the Communication and Dissemination Coordinator (CDC) who will be appointed by SREU leadership, preferably a faculty who already have good background in communication related fields. The CDC will produce quarterly newsletters which will be sent via emails to faculty, students and other interested stakeholders. CDC will also arrange in-house advocacy sessions, develop a basic research portal on the SREU website for dissemination (the technical support to be provided by IT department). The dissemination will increase research visibility and will promote environment of sharing and learning and attract potential funding interests.\n\n2. The Research Business Development Function of MRSCC aims at generating income and funding opportunities for the development and enhancement of research at SREU. The SREU strategic objective is to produce quality education research to get national, regional, and international recognition for its research production. To achieve this objective, SREU seeks to generate enough resources which can’t be attained from government or donors in its entirety. The main function of the Research Business Development will be to create partnerships with private and public universities and provide research service delivery to potential clients. The function will be carried out through two sub-functions of proposal development and industry-linkages and the utilization of financial autonomy.\n2.1 Proposal Development and Industry-Linkages – The key function of the proposal development and industry-linkages is to assist individual teachers, departments, and faculty to develop competitive proposals, bid for research requests, develop individual and joint research proposals, provide support for research budgets, etc… The function will be carried out by Proposal Development Coordinator (PDC) who will be appointed by the SREU leadership. The PDC will be working closely together with other MRSCC coordinators. The function also evolves around income generation and service delivery efforts that will require maintaining close linkages with industry. The PDC will also attend the university-industry advisory council meetings which have been already established by the USWDP support. A substantial institutional capacity in proposal development has been developed by USWDP experts that PDC can hugely benefit from.\n2.2 The Financial Autonomy Support – this function is carried out based on the MoHE bylaws and substantial capacity development work carried out by the USWDP Financial Management expert who was based at SREU for two years. The SREU has comprehensive FA manual that can be used for research income-generation activities. The function will be supported by Financial Autonomy Coordinator who will be appointed by the SREU leadership in close consultation with the head of finance and administration. This position needs to be supported from the administrative staff who undertook comprehensive training offered by USWDP FA expert.\n\n3. The Research Management aims at providing management support by developing necessary management and governance support mechanisms. The research management function has two sub-functions of management and governance.\n3.1 The management function will be carried out by the MRSCC Manager who will be appointed by the SREU leadership. The MRSCC Manager will be working closely with Chancellor and Vice Chancellors to provide management support for the successful implementation of MRSCC functions.\n3.2 The Governance function will be carried out by Research Governance Coordinator (RGC) will who will be providing appropriate policy support and guidance on rules and regulation support to the various MRSCC functions such as SREU’s research policy, research grant management, publication and dissemination policy, incentive policy, etc…",
      "Key Recommendations": "The successful implementation of MRSCC will require strong commitment from SREU leadership, the head of research committee, research committee members, MRSCC function-holders and entire faculty. To keep the momentum continuing, it is recommended that the Graduate Education Senior Manager of USWDP maintains follow up meetings with SREU leadership and head of Research Committee to make sure MRSCC function-holders are appointed soon. It is important that qualified and committed faculty are selected for these critical positions. It is also important that after the first year of successful completion of MRSCC functions, the relevant function-holders are rewarded for their committed contributions and efforts. SREU leadership needs to come up with attractive reward mechanisms for the successful function-holder faculty.\nThe technical consultant for MRSCC has also volunteered to be in touch with SREU leadership and research Committee Members through Skype and provide necessary guidance for the launch and establishment of the MRSCC. If successfully established, the MRSCC will put SREU in the leading expert status among all Afghan universities, bringing SREU the technical leverage to share its expertise with other institutions and generate possible income opportunities as well.\n\nDue to time constraints, the development of MRSCC concept note and implementation plan could only focus on the role of the SREU leadership and faculty. The MRSCC doesn’t provide any direct support to student’s community and how they could be involved and benefit from the research efforts. It is recommended that the SREU leadership and MRSCC function holders consider students’ involvement once MRSCC solidifies institutionalized base at SREU.",

      "Document Title": "LASER PULSE Research for Development (R4D) Workshop Report",
      "Key Findings": "Advance Participant Perception about Research for Development\n-Researchers and practitioners from different organizations fall on different spectrums as related to their understanding of, and experience with, research for development, research translation, research capacity, research experience or capability and their motivation to partner for research. For example, Colombian university researchers rank high in capacity and experience with development research. Some university faculty members have opportunities to work with local communities directly in their research. On the other hand, many practitioners viewed academic research as limited in application to evaluations or assessments. This was noted in pre-workshop activities as well as during workshop sessions, when practitioners asked, \"Why should we partner with researchers? What is the value proposition for us in partnering with them?\"\n-Further segmentation of practitioners as implementers (NGOs), government actors and private sector actors; and researchers in private sector organizations, might be necessary to help with role clarification as relates to research for development. For example, we observed that participants from private sector foundations were challenged to understand their role in the workshop and what value they could add or obtain from such partnerships.\n-The ability for LASER to have the \"right\" (sector expertise) participants at these events was crucial to generate sector specific engagement. The Colombia workshop had a far more targeted group of participants, with respect to the sector priorities. Specific perhaps to Colombia’s greater focus on human rights (as opposed to Uganda’s focus on development) was a suggestion that we might have included demographic and social representatives of our sector focus areas - such as young people, to participate in the Youth sector. This is an ongoing reflection on whether expertise and experience should be balanced by representation and diversity, as we invite participants to these R4D events.\n\nEnhance Communication of the Purpose of R4D events\n-Pre-event engagement with researchers and practitioners was critical to get support and attendance. For example, it was noted from the Colombia pre-workshop activity with practitioners that this activity helped practitioners feel buy-in to the implementation of the workshop agenda.\n-Two R4D objectives must be more effectively communicated of this event: (1) Help researchers and practitioners to network and improve their use of research. (2) Identify/fund opportunities for research, so as to manage researcher expectations when they don’t see their specific research questions on the RFA.\n-Expectations must be clearly articulated during the pre-workshop activities, especially with the USAID Mission offices as we ask them to provide feedback, attend, give connections with their IP’s, etc. The Colombia Mission representatives expressed that their role and responsibilities could have been more clearly articulated in advance.\nContinuous Improvement of CSFA and other LASER Approaches\n-The CSFA survey responses from the scoping/advisory group of experts seemed more astute with respect to the three priority areas. Survey and Synthesis Template inputs from participants during the workshop were far more varied, as anticipated, reflecting the unique individual perspectives of each participant and their respective roles in the system. However, collectively, a significant fraction of participants in each of the challenge areas validated the gaps identified by the scoping groups. After synthesizing the direct outputs of the data instruments, critical gaps identified by participants for missing success factors were captured to help inform the RFA.\n-One recommendation for R4D events was to use local/regional (in this case, Colombian) examples for sessions whenever possible. This would make discussions more relevant to the participants.\n-Advance training of facilitators would better ensure that they are ‘on the same page’ about session content and concepts.\n\nThe strength of the Colombia R4D Workshop was in the depth of engagement from partners, so that the conference seemed to be co-led by local participants. This level of engagement was possible because of Purdue and University of Notre Dame’s long-term partnerships, and the LASER team’s relationships with the government, academic institutions and development organizations in Colombia. Some adjustments from the Uganda R4D - especially around the use of the CSFA-derived sessions enhanced the overall effectiveness of the workshop in generating data to shape the RFA. The successful engagement of participants at the Colombia R4D workshop has contributed to a model for R4D events, which we will use to design all future conferences. A caveat here is that context and opportunity are important elements in the implementation of any event.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. We will take advantage of LASER consortium connections as well as mission enthusiasm for the LASER approach in the selection of the R4D event host country or region. This ensures we are able to delve deeper into context, and to engage our boundary partners earlier and more effectively.\n2. Continue to elaborate pre-event engagement activities. We will continue to engage practitioners and researchers as groups prior to the event, as early on as possible. This ensures that these participants feel a sense of ownership in the event, and are likely (as they did in Colombia), take on session facilitation roles. It also means they are more prepared for the event, having thought through the challenges to engaging with researchers (or practitioners, depending on the participant); their previous experiences engaging with the other, and the terms and outcomes of that engagement to share with other event participants. And, of course, it means that they are able to propose research gaps in the USAID sectors presented as priorities for the event. This also provides us with an opportunity to define ‘research,’ so that researchers and practitioners alike aren’t only thinking in terms of a research study that results in a peer-reviewed and published paper, but see it as LASER would like them to, which is as ‘the expertise of a researcher applied in collaboration with practitioners, to a development challenge identified from the field, resulting in an innovative product, new practices, or policy recommendations, and for which there is a ready application once the researcher-implementer joint work is concluded.\n3. Continue to improve the process to refine the sector priorities for the R4D workshop. The ability of LASER to have identified system gaps per sector at a very granular level by the time of the event is crucial to our expecting to have RFA focus areas emerge from it. And to get to this, we need to have the sector focus clearly identified and narrowed, and the feedback on gaps from the Scoping Group members (sometimes called Advisory or Leadership Group in the past) through the pre-workshop CSFA survey.\na. We will seek to send out the CSFA sector survey to Scoping Group members as early in the process as possible. However, the caveat for effectively performing this activity is the advance time required to refine the CSFA surveys with USAID Mission’s input on specific priorities in particular sectors. For example, USAID Vietnam Mission’s direction towards water and air pollution specifically under the broad sector ‘watershed’ or ‘water resource management’.\nb. The other prerequisite for the success of this activity is the ability to identify in advance the Scoping Group members, given the special selection criteria of this group (as discussed on Page 5 of this report). The pre-workshop engagement activities will be crucial for engaging and identifying the “right” experts for the Scoping Group.\n4. Continue to identify processes and activities that can be standardized across different R4D events, but customize and adapt to cultural and contextual needs of the region. Despite success we have using certain approaches in a given country, we recognize the need to adapt our approaches to the socio-political and cultural context of the next R4D event host country. What worked well in the context of Colombia might not work well in the context of Vietnam. Some elements of the R4D events will remain: The How-To of Translation, and the use of CSFA to refine the USAID-identified sector priorities, for example. But we will adapt how we present these in a culturally responsive manner.",

      "Key Findings": "In examining the key features of the ecosystem and comparing them to successful innovation hubs elsewhere, the primary tendency that emerges is a disconnection of actors in the Vietnamese ecosystem. Many startups serve a market of small and medium-sized enterprises, but that relationship is often one-way, with little feedback sought by or offered to the startup. Large domestic enterprises rarely acquire startups; instead, they invest in them primarily as a matter of social responsibility than of market imperative. Foreign tech companies offer little in terms of technology transfer or transformative development of a foundational innovation workforce. Government programs are too often built on a supply rather than a demand basis, offering support that is not much wanted or that adds little value. Academic research lacks links to market application or need. There are exceptions to all of these features, but the general tendencies remain.\nThe legal and regulatory framework is improving, but major challenges remain, particularly with respect to the investment and business environment, intellectual property, the uncertain environment for fintech, and use of data. Some of these issues create significant barriers to progress.",
      "Key Recommendations": "USAID might consider programming that is organized along human-centered design principles to help alleviate some of these problems and better connect the ecosystem’s actors to one another and to consumers – particularly consumers from underserved communities.\n\nSupport to the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI) and other GVN stakeholders on legal and regulatory reform.\n\nInstitutional support to the National Innovation Center.\n\nLaunching other government programming in support of the ecosystem.\n\nSupport to Intellectual Property Enforcement.\n\nPublic-Private Incubator/Accelerator Partnership.\n\nBuilding connections between innovators and SMEs.\n\nCapacity building for women and other vulnerable entrepreneurs on digital transformation issues.\n\nSupport to a fintech industry association.\n\nA technical platform to enable reach to underserved communities.\n\nCompetitions to promote innovations in under addressed areas.\n\nDirect support to curriculum change.\n\nSupport to ancillary activities.\n\nIntroduction of HCD training in the university system.\n\nSupport to U.S.-Vietnam university partnerships.\n\nIntroduction of ethics in training around AI and responsible data use.\n\nImprovement of cybersecurity training.\n\nAn IP support center.\n\nTwinning.",

      "Key Findings": "The first review team concluded that PCARRD utilized Loan II funds effectively to achieve the goals of improving the research capability in the Philippines:\n- Manpower development provided training for 71 B.S., 398 M.S., and 70 Ph.D. candidates. Short-term, non-degree training and travel grants were provided for 186 individuals. Two thirds of the training grant awards were made to institutions outside the Manila/Los Banos area in support of geographic decentralization to enable more direct support to small farmers.\n- Equipment and library materials worth about $2.4 million were delivered to the eight centers and the PCARRD Secretariat. The Project completed $5 million work of infrastructure development\nprojects in the centers.\n- The ability of PCARRD to influence research management, especially toward the small farmer, was reflected in an increase of PCARRD-funded research under Loan II outside the Manila/Los Banos area from 23% in 1981 to 50% in 1983. The corresponding amount of funds for these projects went from 11% in 1981 to 40% in 1983. During its existence concurrent with Loans I and II, PCARRD has generated over 700 million pesos of research support from GOP and international sources. The report stated that the system has developed research priorities related to development goals and improved research management practices and policies which reduce duplication of research projects, improve accountability, and encourage dissemination and utilization of results.\n\nThe second review team in their impact evaluation focused on the expected output of \"an increased and sustained flow of research information, especially to aid small farmers.\" A summary of findings follow:\n- \"the research institutions aided by this project have already had some positive impact on small farmers and will have greater impact in the near future. The economic impacts so far have been in corn, rice, and rubber, and in the next five years there will be significant impacts on sweet potato productivity. The regional institutions are playing an important role in solving regional and national problems.\"",
      "Key Recommendations": "The two most important lessons learned from the Project are the need to (1) carefully analyze recipient institutions' capabilities to use and maintain research equipment and to procure equipment accordingly, and 2) prepare a comprehensive book/journal procurement which provides recipient institutions\nwith a basic research library rather than purchasing reference materials based on each recipient institution's requests.\n\nRelative to impact, the team cited four points about research that are\npertinent to the evaluation of successful research efforts.\n1. It takes research longer than most projects before an impact is\nrealized.\n2. Research is inherently uncertain with a few big payoff projects\npaying for a large number of projects that never have any payoff,\n3. For research to have impact, a system to disseminate technology\nand provide production inputs and market products must be in\nplace. It is impossible to separate the effects of research\nfrom extension, input supply, and price policy.\n4. On a worldwide basis investment in medium to long-term research\nagricultural has been an extremely productive.\n\nRecommendations for action:\n1. Follow up with PCARRD to insure compliance with July, 1987\ndeadline to utilize currently unused laboratory equipment.\n2. Encourage PCARRD to establish a process for assessment of the\nimpact of research within their normal evaluation procedure and\nto publicize success stories.",

      "Document Title": "Evaluation of the USAID-Funded Collaborative Agricultural Research Networks in West and Central Africa",
      "Key Findings": "1. The history of the agricultural research Networks in WCA shows a strong record of major, sustained investment and support by USAID that is widely recognized and appreciated within the region.\n\n2. The Networks have amply demonstrated their importance and value to regional, collaborative agricultural research in WCA, making them well positioned to contribute significantly to IEHA.\n\n3. It is difficult to fully and accurately assess Network impact, due to insufficient data, and this poses a problem for the Networks as they seek to make the case for increased financial support.\n\n4. The full and active involvement in the research process by farmers (the primary client and targeted end‐user) has shown its great value in helping ensure that research specifically addresses and focuses on farmers’ needs and constraints (demand‐driven, not supply‐driven research), thereby resulting in higher rates of adoption of new varieties and other technologies truly suited to the specific circumstances of farmers.\n\n5. There continues to be a widespread lack of good Internet connectivity throughout much of WCA, a situation which impedes the ability of Network scientists to communicate with each other and the rest of the agricultural research and development (R&D) community.\n\n6. African universities, especially faculties of agriculture, seem largely uninvolved in Network programs, which is a lost opportunity for both and a detriment to WCA farmers.\n\n7. Despite the valued services and functions provided by the Networks, national governments in the region have not yet summoned the political will nor found the necessary means internally to begin funding Network research on their own.\n\n8. R&D progress made by the Networks to date, together with the changing conditions in the region as well as the evolving needs of farmers and others in the cereal subsector, require new strategic directions, programs, and partners.\n\n9. New areas of emphasis of the Networks would benefit greatly from additional specialized expertise to ensure rapid initial progress and near‐term results, specifically in seed systems, post‐harvest processing, and learning modules for improved production environments.\n\n10. As the Networks assess and embark on new strategic directions, this provides an excellent opportunity for thinking creatively about program emphases, new partnerships, and potential cross‐network activities.\n\n11. Many serious and thoughtful ideas have been expressed by USAID and the key Network partners about the best way to move forward in reconfiguring or combining (or not) the existing Networks, and in considering where to locate the Network coordination units (CUs).",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. WARP and its key partners should carefully review the remarkable history and achievements of agricultural research Networks in WCA, with a view to making their decisions regarding the future of the Networks within the larger historical context and longer term development goals and vision of the region.\n\n2. The current investors (NARS, IARCs, USAID, CORAF) should continue, if not increase, their support for these Networks by making a reasonably long‐term funding commitment, subject to the Networks’ continued evolution in response to changing needs of farmers and the cereal sector, increased impact, and periodic review and assessment.\n\n3. The Networks should work together and in conjunction with the NARS to develop systems to collect and analyze the necessary data to better quantify the socioeconomic impact of Network activities at the farm level.\n\n4. The Networks should much more strongly encourage and promote the application and use of farmer‐participatory methods in all future Network research programs, with the expectation of spillover of these approaches into national research programs.\n\n5. USAID, CORAF, FARA, and other interested partners should undertake, with a sense of urgency, a study on the technical and economic feasibility of establishing and maintaining satellite linkages to allow vastly improved Internet connectivity for key research stations and groups throughout the region.\n\n6. The Networks should make specific plans to establish linkages with training and research programs in the African university community.\n\n7. The NARS, individually and collectively through CORAF, should find new creative and persuasive ways, through the influence of their combined strength and within the auspices of the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD), to appeal to national governments to change their policies related to funding of national research and, as a start, to cover the costs of some of the Networks’ research programs.\n\n8. The Networks should all carefully review both the balance of funding research and technology transfer in their programming as well as the creation of synergies between activities to maximize opportunities for vigorously moving promising technologies into the hands and fields of farmers.\n\n9. USAID, in conjunction with other donors, should consider funding, for a limited period of three to five years, three internationally recruited scientist positions to provide regionally oriented, Network‐connected support in the areas of seed systems, post‐harvest processing, and improved production environments.\n\n10. In their next phase of development, the Networks should begin to consider a larger vision and build areas of programmatic cross‐network activity. \n\n11. The leadership of the Networks, working in conjunction with CORAF and WARP, should design and facilitate a process, based on consensus and compromise, for arriving at a set of changes to the Networks’ configuration and coordination base.",

      "Key Findings": "The evaluation team believes that the following five elements contribute to CSISA’s distinctiveness in R&D in India, Bangladesh and Nepal:\n\n--the concept of the hub for an alliance of key stakeholders to focus R&D\n\n--the emphasis on service providers for appropriate mechanization adoption\n\n--the mix of private- and public-sector partnerships\n\n--cropping systems perspective\n\n--the validation of prospective technologies in participatory on-farm trials\n\n--the effective integration of supportive, socioeconomic and policy research",
      "Key Recommendations": "The following is a selected list of recommendations. A fuller discussion of the ET's recommendations can be found in the Recommendation section (see p. 40).\n\n1. We recommend continued emphasis on the following R&D activities that are central to CSISA: \n• Optimization of rice-wheat production systems in Bihar and Eastern Uttar Pradesh in India \n• Optimization of rice-based production systems in “low-yielding” Kharif rice systems typified by Odisha (also relevant in\nJharkhand and other states of East India)\n• Optimization of rice-based production systems in central and northern Bangladesh, including Rangpur and Mymensingh\nhubs, each with about 15 million people\n• Optimization of rice-wheat production systems in the Terai of central and western Nepal; hill-lands R&D to continue only\nif appropriately funded\n\n2.We recommend that in Phase III, CSISA-India draft as project outputs one to three carefully crafted ‘investment-grade’ joint proposals in collaboration with the state governments of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh to massively disseminate the ‘early’ rice-wheat cropping system. These large joint endeavors may also benefit from assistance of the Investment Center of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), perhaps with funding for formulation from the Asian Development Bank or from the International Fund for Agriculture Development (IFAD), if necessary.\n\n3. We recommend that one or more donors enable CSISA, perhaps with support of other partners, to delineate soils and water resources, in parallel with studies on socio-economic constraints for “rabi fallow” zones in Odisha, to enable the targeting of sustainable intensification research.\n\n4. We recommend that CSISA-MI be strengthened, perhaps with support of other advanced water management partners, to assist the Government of Bangladesh to formulate and map out strategies to mitigate saline toxicity in its mandate area of southern Bangladesh.\n\n5. We recommend that USAID and/or BMGF support mechanization in hubs in northern and northwestern Bangladesh where private-sector partners need science support on mechanization.\n\n6. We recommend that in order to stimulate greater integration between agronomists, who are undertaking specific and process research, and plant breeders, who are working on rice and wheat \nvarietal development, we recommend that CSISA consult and explore, with national agricultural research systems’ (NARS) leadership, workable protocols enabling NARS scientists to appraise and advance breeding lines in controlled on-farm \nenvironments in India, Bangladesh and Nepal.\n\n7. We recommend that plant breeding continue to be an integral part of CSISA in Phase III for South Asia. Crop management is rapidly changing on the Indo-Gangetic Plain. Varieties need to be selected to optimize dynamic new production systems, especially emphasizing early maturity, heat tolerance and resistance to plant diseases that are emerging with the new production interventions. Close interactions between breeders and agronomists will reinforce the process of change and accelerate the turnover of improved new cultivars.",

      "Key Findings": "Inclusive Capacity Building: The involvement of practitioners and external stakeholders in knowledge exchange and information sharing was a good practice and therefore an important approach in enhancing the link between the academic sphere and practice. The growing interest among students, faculty and staff at UoN to attend seminars and public lectures whose speakers/presenters were drawn from external stakeholders reflects this.\n\nImportance of Institutionalization: Partners learned that it takes time to mobilize support within the UoN system (the department and UoN management, Senate, University Council) to support a project’s institutionalization. Because of CSDES’s success, its institutionalization is being fast-tracked. The UoN administration has expressed the desire that CSDES be upgraded from a center to an institute to give it wider mandate within and without the University.\n\nValue of engaging Drylands Communities: CSU-UoN partners realized that communities and counties in drylands areas are ready and willing to take up research findings and there is a high demand for well-designed/practical research outputs and \n technologies. Furthermore, the project realized that it needs to collaborate closely with other partners to build the human/technical capacity of communities and county governments to facilitate application of sustainable land management practices, governance (in natural resource management), and economic growth and resilience building.\n\nHost-Institution Ownership of Partnership Activities: Partners learned the importance of transferring project responsibilities to local partners early in the project’s life cycle. By supporting local (CSDES) staff and building leadership early on, the partnership knew that it would have better opportunities for sustainability. By the end of the partnership, almost all activities were transferred to CSDES including reporting and tracking finances.",

      "Document ID": "1503-HAUGE-IDN",
      "Document Title": "Mid-Term Evaluation of the Indonesian Higher Education Leadership and Management (HELM) Project",
      "Key Findings": "LESSON 1: A robust design and proposal can help a project withstand even the most extreme challenges including extreme distortion of the original design; particularly the increase from 25 to 50 higher education institutions across the whole of the archipelago and the truncation of the original time frame for carrying out key strategic and analytical tasks, a serious time gap between the release of the request for proposals and the mobilization of the HELM contractor, and flux in project personnel including those in the most senior positions.\n\nLESSON 2: A project that is advertised as building human and institutional development capacity for leadership and management must ensure that it reflects the principles of HICD and provides strategic and effective leadership and management. Higher education institutions internationally and certainly in Indonesia are notorious for their organizational rigidity and for working in silos. An implementing partner must take care to ensure that its organizational structures and technical units do not \n mirror the very organizational issues faced by its counterpart organizations. For example, the four core areas of HELM operate in isolation from each other and do not yet exploit the synergies and other benefits that could come from internal collaboration. If the project does not demonstrate competence in applying HICD principles and practices and forward looking strategic planning and management, the stakeholders may call the credibility of the project into question. This is counter-productive.\n\nLESSON 3: A lesson often cited in international development literature over the past two decades is that institutional development is a medium- to long-term endeavor and donor agencies should expect to invest in such an initiative at a respective institution for a minimum of 10 to 15 years in order to see results. HELM is a five-year project, so it is already compromised regarding the ideal implementation period. The challenges the project has faced with building the capacity of DIKTI and institutionalizing desired change within partner organizations without a clear strategy that is informed by a risk assessment further compound the situation.\n\nLESSON 4: Strategic communication for development purposes should be a serious endeavor. A lack of investment in this area will result in investment waste in other areas. For example while a series of very high quality literature reviews and research studies have been produced by acknowledged international and local experts, the insights contained in these documents have not communicated effectively to a range of audiences. This situation ultimately means that the very individuals the products are intended to benefit are not utilizing the knowledge products.\n\nLESSON 5: Shifts in socio-cultural norms open up spaces for groups that are excluded from participation. If a project is able to recognize and respond to these openings, it is often the case that a very small investment can yield significant dividends. The Women in Leadership initiative is a case in point: for a small project investment that covered the cost of around 50 – 60 women and men to attend a short workshop and then for a small investment on the part of their home institutions to conduct a short seminar for selected female staff, significant and unexpected dividends emerged. If HELM is able to exploit this obvious low-hanging fruit, the project will have helped bring about a substantive development results that will have far-reaching, and ultimately quantifiable, effects. However, if the project is unable to seize the day and the response to such an opening is timid or unfocused, the opportunity will be lost.\n\nLESSON 6: A good indicator can be hard to find. But if a project wants to tell the story of its real achievements as convincingly as possible, good indicators that conform to sound principles must be identified. These indicators perhaps sit beneath or alongside required USAID indicators and they tell the story of achievements that goes beyond reporting on numbers on metrics of interest to the project. Up until now, HELM has not found the right indicators that enable its story to be told and that reveal, rather than obscure, the emerging development results.",
      "Key Recommendations": "RECOMMENDATION 1: Hold an intensive workshop to focus HELM implementation on consolidation of results from activities, \n sustainability and institutionalization for the final two years of the project. Without an all-out effort to regroup, develop and embed a strategic plan into HELM, the end results of the project and the overall development impact will suffer.\n\nRECOMMENDATION 2: Act immediately to ensure the quality, relevance and appropriateness of the executive/professional development for higher education leadership and management materials.\n\nRECOMMENDATION 3: Bring the HELM databases up to a generally accepted standard. To do so, contract STTA with bona fide credentials in database design that can apply accepted principles and norms for database design, including the development of unique identification numbers. HELM monitoring and evaluation personnel will then need to clean and re-interrogate the existing HELM data.\n\nRECOMMENDATION 4: Prioritize the approach to the 25 new Cohort 2 institutions in the following ways:\n\nRECOMMENDATION 5: Produce a gender and social equity analysis and gender and social equity integration strategy in collaboration with the 50 HEIs and DIKTI and BAN-PT. An immediate action that could be carried out is to ensure that the Women in Leadership action plans are initiated at all 50 HEIs. The strategy should recognize that HELM has only two years remaining. While the gender and social equity analysis may not make a significant contribution to HELM implementation at this point in time, the output of the exercise may help inform future USAID investments in higher education. Beyond the self- efficacy indicator, ensure that the HEIs track and report on the number of women who move up the ladder as a result of HELM empowerment activities and change in men’s attitudes about and advocacy for female empowerment.",

We collected data prospectively and then surveyed a representative sample of 100 alumni (94% response), assessing Program impacts on their careers and collaborations. Frequently, collaborations continued beyond the formal training period with U.S.- (63%) and site-based mentors (66%). U.S. Fellows\nreported the highest post-training focus on research (88 on a 100-point scale), and the highest Program impact on competitiveness for career or training positions and choices of post-training topics and institutions (95 points). Interest in global health research increased markedly during the training period, especially for LMIC trainees, and was sustained post-training. LMIC alumni reported a significantly higher focus on global health and research than did U.S. alumni. Alumni reported that their mentored research training had a substantial impact on their career trajectories.",

Due to the limited funding for research in some regions and the magnitude of socio-economic and developmental challenges, these programmes are seen as of strategic importance in developing research capacity and contributing meaningfully to solve challenges. Programmes that are particularly valued are those that focus on the priorities of the South, recognise the mutual value to both the North and South, emphasise knowledge sharing, Southern leadership, and support improved scientific infrastructure and publication in international journals. Additional reasons for Northern funders include improving development outcomes, for science diplomacy, responding to the internationalisation of science and to work with the best scientists wherever they are in the world.\n\nDespite the wide-range of practices and processes implemented, there are still many challenges that interviewees felt needed to be addressed to fully establish equitable research partnerships in the future.\n\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "10 ways in which funders can influence equitable partnerships:\n1. Inclusive agenda-setting\n2. Funding new research questions and valuing complementary skills and knowledge\n3. Setting the tone \n4. Rewarding skilled project managers and team players\n5. Looking for equity beyond the leaders \n6. Equitable budgets, research and financial management\n7. Providing ongoing institutional capacity strengthening\n8. Widening participation  \n9. Investing for the long-term\n10. Working closely with other funders and agencies in the North and South",

      "Key Findings": "• Leaders employ the evidence they perceive as most helpful to diagnose problems, set priorities, and design or inform implementation strategies\n• Leaders use national statistics and evaluation data most frequently and also found them to be the most helpful sources of development data\n• Leaders overall give the nod to qualitative analysis as most helpful by a slim margin, though government officials appear to place a higher premium on impact evaluations\n• Leaders use national level information more frequently than cross-national or subnational information\n• The majority of leaders use information that they discover from in-person interactions, either via formal meetings or informal communications\n• Leaders generally view domestic sources of data and analysis to be quite helpful, but give government agencies the highest marks as information providers\n• The value of non-governmental information is highly context specific: data and analysis produced by local civil society is most helpful in countries with open civic space\n• Leaders put data and analysis from development partners at the top of the class when it comes to the helpfulness of international information sources\n• Not all development partners are equally popular: multilateral organizations command a larger user base for their data and analysis than their bilateral counterparts overall\n• Multilateral organizations with a specific regional or sectoral focus are viewed as the most helpful international information sources\n• Multilateral development partners, the United States, and Germany punch well above their financial weight in terms of attracting domestic uptake of their data and analysis\n• Large bilateral and multilateral donors were generally rated as more helpful information providers, but focused multilaterals appear to punch above their financial weight",
      "Key Recommendations": "i. What are the most helpful sources of information doing right?\na. Context is key: to capture the attention of leaders, information providers must demonstrate a clear understanding of local realities in LICs and MICs\nb. Be constructive: to motivate leaders to take action, information providers should not only diagnose problems, but offer practical policy recommendations\nc. Know your niche: leaders expect somewhat different things from domestic and international information providers, which is an opportunity for greater specialization\n\nii. Why do less helpful sources of data and analysis miss the mark?\na. Stand out: to break through the noise, leaders want domestic sources of information to offer new and specific insights\nb. Be responsive: leaders want international sources of information to be more aligned with national priorities\n\niii. What can information providers do differently to be more helpful?\na. Co-create with users: engage leaders throughout the process of collecting, interpreting, and disseminating information to increase uptake\nb.  Increase quality: domestic producers should prioritize remedying technical deficiencies, such as improving the quality and timeliness of their information",

      "Document Title": "Feed the Future Ghana Agriculture Technology Transfer Project Final Project Report 2013-2018",
      "Key Findings": "A. Seed\nSeed Market: Due to farmers’ longstanding mistrust in the quality of certified seeds, continuing efforts are required in promoting their use in the zone of intervention. The market for certified maize seed is still emerging and is dominated by a single open-pollinated variety in the case of maize; still, opportunities are available for expansion and for the use of hybrids and other varieties that address biotic and abiotic stresses faced by smallholder farmers in the northern regions. The project also was able to demonstrate the suitability of inclusion of other crops into the system to suit different agro-ecological environments. While the project has invested in technologies and infrastructure to increase demand for and use of certified seed, these efforts must be sustained with follow-on activities.\n\nFarmer Uptake: In the past, certified seeds were not typically available in a timely manner due to poor accessibility, with distance as the major constraint, along with poor seed quality issues due to lack of proper seed testing facilities. ATT tackled this by upgrading seed processing and quality control facilities in the region and improved farmer accessibility to quality seeds by introducing mobile seed vans that served as an effective means to bring certified seed to the doorsteps of farmers living in remote\ncommunities.\n\nB. Soil\nSoil Testing: ATT realized that farm-level soil testing supported by nutrient management decision support tools often resulted in higher yields. Yet, there is a need to develop such capacities in the region, particularly to enable extensive soil mapping that includes secondary and micronutrients in addition to major nutrients (N, P, K), that should be supported by specific crop-level fertilizer recommendations. Infrastructure is needed in terms of either establishing new soil testing labs or upgrading existing facilities with new technology and tools. \n\nUDP: Time-lapse photography from drone-based research has shown that rice fields using UDP application attained faster growth and maturity and also resulted in higher yields compared to non-UDP field plots. Despite these benefits, inadequate access to briquetting machines remains a constraint to farmer uptake of this technology at a larger scale.\n\nC. Water\nDouble Cropping, Dual Income: Dry season farming using rainwater harvesting technology is a major strategy for increasing farmers’ incomes and helping them move out of poverty. Double cropping is particularly effective when the first crop is maize and the second crop is a high-value vegetable, such as pepper. More research is  needed on different forms and scale-up of water- harvesting technologies, such as PAVE and Bhungroo technology, that will make second cropping a possibility in northern Ghana.\n\nD. Technology Dissemination \nTo increase farmer demand for and adoption of new technologies, multiple approaches and broad-based information dissemination methods that inspire behavior change are needed. In all ATT-based interventions, state-of-the-art dissemination mechanisms using ICT tools were employed to reach a maximum number of farmers in a short period of time and at a lower cost. ATT moved from reaching hundreds of farmers through traditional field days to thousands of farmers in remote communities through the integrated use of ICT as a technology dissemination mechanism. One of the key ICT-based tools, viz., video screening, was used to reach farmers with agricultural extension information across rural communities in Northern Ghana. Also included were the use of e-extension, radio broadcasting, enhanced ICT capacities of research institutions, drone technology for crop evaluations, etc. All ICT extension efforts were focused on reaching the last-mile clientele – small farm households.\n\nE. Partnership and Sustainability\nIn order to ensure sustainability of ATT-based interventions, even after the end of the project, ATT activities focused on developing three types of key partnerships from the beginning: 1. Partnerships with local communities and stakeholders for implementation purposes; 2. Public-private partnerships; 3. Partnerships to ensure government support.\n\nF. Project Management\nMaintaining a core project team speeds up delivery. Higher staffing turnover, especially at the management level, results in changes in vision and strategic direction, which can slow the pace of implementation. Efforts must be made to maintain a core intact team so there is not a lag in project implementation. Another key is decentralized management through local implementation and partnerships.\n\nG. Gender\nImproving value-added skills through better crop management practices and creating better business opportunities (e.g., GAPs training, line transplanting, and fertilizer application and irrigation) at three different levels – targeting women farm laborers, farmers, and entrepreneurs – resulted in increased incomes and enhanced their skills and knowledge.\n\nH. Climate Resilience\nWeather uncertainties, with delayed onset and earlier withdrawal of rains and uneven rain distribution, have greatly influenced the cropping systems and calendar in the areas where ATT was in operation. Any interventions or technologies must therefore offer climate-smart and resilience approaches that adequately respond to weather uncertainties. ATT activities focused on the efficient use of inputs, such as introducing drought-tolerant crops and varieties into the system, through research and technology transfer; soil fertility-enhancing and efficient technologies such as UDP; and water conservation measures through the introduction of dry season farming using rainwater harvesting.\n\nI. Finance and Grants\nATT extended grants or facilitated direct financing for selected projects that enabled the development of crucial infrastructure and technical capacities for the agriculture sector. Future grants and financing mechanisms should be well targeted and further build private sector capacity and investment.",
      "Key Recommendations": "A. Seed\n--For measurable impact or transformation, interventions must target the whole system, along with its actors, rather than just one\naspect of the value chain. For example, promoting the use of certified seed must not only focus on the users; it must start with\nresearchers and breeding agencies.\n--Through infrastructure and logistics support to research and regulatory institutions, ATT removed bottlenecks in the development and release of certified seeds. The foundation has been set for these institutions to provide enhanced seed varietal development, release, and inspection services, but continuing efforts are needed to further increase their effectiveness and efficiency.\n--In addition, the Seed Inspection Division of MOFA should be decentralized and resourced to strengthen the monitoring functions at the divisional level.\n--ATT enhanced the capacity of local seed companies and LIPs to distribute seeds to last-mile customers using mobile seed vans and trained community sales agents. These efforts increased farmers’ access, built farmer demand, and strengthened business for local companies. More vans are needed to further assist retailers to travel to hard-to-reach communities. This can be enabled by designing proper financing mechanisms through innovative partnerships. Moreover, additional seed laboratories at the district level could reduce transportation costs for seed producers and LIPs.\n--ATT engaged the private sector to produce certified seed in a timelier manner by helping them access modern seed processing\nequipment. Financing mechanisms can help additional seed processor procure new seed testing and processing equipment to replace obsolete ones.\n\nB. Soil\n--ATT promoted soil sampling and analysis as a basic first step in farming. Greater access to simple soil testing methods is needed. For example, soil test labs should be established at the district level to make the service accessible to all farmers.\n--Training of agriculture officers and farmers in soil mapping should be expanded and sustained to provide location-specific fertilizer recommendations.\n--It is important to promote urea briquetting as a key entrepreneurial activity across local communities to improve the uptake of products and thus adoption of the UDP method. UDP briquettes also are proven to be more efficient compared to traditional nitrogenous fertilizers, such as ammonium\nsulfate\n--Still, a huge knowledge gap exists among farmers in understanding the availability of fertilizer types and recommendations and the quantity and timing of their application. This warrants more capacity building and knowledge transfer mechanisms.\n--Fertilizer blending companies should be encouraged to supply site-specific fertilizers to various regions and districts in order to promote balanced fertilization among farmers.\n\nC. Water\n--Water harvesting and storage technology should be further explored and expanded/scaled up to more farming areas and communities. The Department of Agriculture should promote expansion of the Bhungroo and PAVE technology.\n--A program for organizing farmer groups or associations to make efficient use of the Bhungroo and PAVE technology is one option for scale up.\n--Women can earn extra income and increase family-level nutrition through the production and sale of vegetables grown using water-harvesting and small-scale irrigation methods that facilitate dry season farming. Any future award of grants in this area should be gender-sensitive to capitalize on these benefits.",

      "Document Title": "Final Report: Feed the Future Ghana Agriculture Policy Support Project",
      "Key Findings": "The project has established a “before” and “after” legacy in Ghana’s agricultural political economy through the project’s multiple interventions. These interventions assisted counterparts with creating an evidence-based agriculture policymaking process that incorporates inputs from researchers and the private sector, including civil society and the media. Some of these legacies are summarized below.\n\n• The project built the Ministry of Food and Agriculture’s capacity to identify, develop, analyze, and implement agriculture policies that are supported by empirical analysis. Ministry staff now provide timely policy advice to ministry key decision-makers.\n\n• The local research community, comprising major public universities and think tanks, increased their research capacities with project support and developed a set of evidence-based policy research studies to make significant adjustments to Ghana’s agriculture policies and programs. The Ministry of Food and\nAgriculture is committed to incorporating recommendations as part of their policymaking process.\n\n• Research efforts resulted in mutual respect and ongoing engagement between researchers and the public sector to ensure a continued flow of knowledge into the policymaking process. Researchers and the ministry will continue the Agriculture Research Summit annually as an example to sustain their collaboration.\n\n• Private sector stakeholders, with project support, are now better prepared and motivated to engage with the public sector in meaningful discussions to strengthen food security and work toward an enabling environment to promote private sector investments in Ghana’s food industry. NASTAG, NETRIGHT,\nHAG, and the media — all critical players for agriculture policy advocacy — are continuing to convene and strengthen public-private dialogue.\n\n• The Agriculture Policy Support Project’s support of policy reforms, strategies, and advocacy initiatives has influenced seed production and related institutional arrangements. The ministry, the project, and development partners created plans to scale up and ensure continuity along with the inherent market demand for available, affordable, and high-quality seed. The public sector’s strengthened regulatory capacity and better-defined role to monitor the seed industry and seed quality has created private sector opportunities to engage in seed production, including early generation seeds, and in key services provision for seed certification.\n\n• Project activities to mainstream gender in agriculture policy are contributing to gender inclusion in Ghana. Activities included gender-focused research, public sector and CSO training on GADS II, and CSO capacity building to strengthen women in agriculture policy advocacy. NETRIGHT effectively advocated to incorporate important clauses to improve women’s access to land and secure\ntheir rights as spouses of marriages “not institutionalized” into the Land Bill. These are before Parliament for approval.",

First, with the right supports, a wide range of Indonesian HEIs succeeded in diving into significant, world-class research. Second, despite initial fears, Indonesian HEIs worked well together in these endeavors, sharing resources and finding mutual benefit. Third, building the scaffolding and relationships to undertake such research is a lengthy process, but provides a good return on this investment. Fourth, Indonesian HEIs have much to contribute to the development challenges facing the nation. Fifth, there is much to be gained by building even more comprehensive partnerships between U.S. and Indonesian HEIs.",

      "Document Title": "An Evaluation of the Cooperative Association of States for Scholarships Program",
      "Key Findings": "1. Since its establishment, the Cooperative Association of States for Scholarships (CASS) has introduced innumerable changes to reflect the changing environment and to incorporate lessons learned.\n2. The CASS program has incorporated changes to address almost all of the recommendations offered in the 1994 evaluation. These include changes in their program offerings, internal management, and budgeting.\n3. CASS’s selection of technical areas (subjects) for training adequately reflects the needs of the labor markets in the eight countries.\n4. CASS efforts to ensure that its fields of study reflect USAID’s strategic priorities appear to be increasingly effective.\n5. The procedures on which Georgetown University’s Center for Intercultural Education and Development (CIED) relies to choose new fields of study, schools offering them, and new institutional directions have been effective at advancing the CASS mission in the last eight years.\n6. CASS efforts are reaching the appropriate low-income and minority populations.\n7. CASS has had a strong positive impact on the participating colleges, their U.S. students, and the people in the surrounding towns and cities.\n8. The CASS program effectively furnishes man, appropriate types of help to students in the U.S. and to the recently returned graduates.\n9. CASS graduates continue to experience some difficulty transferring U.S. credits to colleges in their countries, made only somewhat easier by the reciprocity agreements.\n10. The evaluation team’s interviews provided many positive examples of changes in participants’ thinking about the U.S. and about the democratization process in their own countries.\n11. The cost-share model is successful, partly owing to substantial U.S. and home-country, in-kind donations.\n12. CASS’s incorporation of several new fields of study appears to have the potential to improve the quality of rural education, health, and housing services.\n13. CASS draws the majority of its students from areas outside of the capital cities. The training leads many CASS students to seek employment in more urban areas than those from which they came.\n14. Employers in the CASS countries appear to value and readily accept the CASS degrees and certificates. Interviews with returned participants and with employers suggest that the training helps alumni to advance in their career once employed.\n15. Interviews with alumni, individually and in focus groups, with their employers, and with specialists in the labor markets indicate that the CASS model of training is successful to very successful at disseminating what has been learned during their academic programs.\n16. The training of each CASS student affects many people, both in his/her home country and in the United States.\n17. Few, if any, training programs are similar to CASS. CASS targets rural, underprivileged young people and requires an in-country staff in order to reach the right kind of participant. This uniqueness precludes calculating cost-effectiveness based on comparisons with others.\n18. An assessment of four of the several CASS survey forms reveals that the M&E system produces clear, adequate, and useful information for USAID reporting needs.\n19. The evaluation team found that the CASS program is well designed and managed.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. CASS should explore the possibility of increasing contributions to the program through (1) collaboration with PVOs and NGOs such as Partners of the Americas, Ashoka, World Wildlife Fund, Conservation International, and others, and (2) undertaking a campaign in the participating countries to increase public awareness of the program.\n2. Explore and invest in low-cost options to increase CASS visibility in the participating countries. The CASS Program has a great story to tell about disadvantaged young people who receive an incredible opportunity to experience another world, who come home and find their lives changed forever.\n3. Explore methods to broaden contacts with local organizations, such as the various Chambers of Commerce in each country.\n4. CASS should examine ways to expand its linkages and partnering with other organizations in each country, especially European, Japanese, and other U.S. organizations that may provide resources and funding to underwrite scholarship costs (for example, Peace Corps, Partners of the Americas, AED, and others).\n5. Consider creating an Internet-based directory of alumni, which would permit searches by name, field of study, country, year of program, etc.\n6. Strengthen alumni associations in some of the eight countries. For example, the Guatemalan ties and activities lacked vitality or were non-existent. CASS might profitably review what are the “best practices” in Honduras, for instance, that may be useful as lessons for countries where these networks have faltered or become frayed.\n7. Strengthen the cooperation between CASS and USAID on the selection of areas of study and in other areas.\n8. Continue to explore ways to facilitate the transfer of college credits to institutions in the home countries. The evaluation recognizes that making the transfer of course credits to home countries easier is a challenge with no straightforward way to address.\n9. Investigate the possibility of providing some additional, low-cost English training to candidates prior to their travel to the U.S.\n10. Consider maintaining applicant files for a standard period—such as three to five years. Such standardization in the eight countries would (1) facilitate their tracking of repeat applicants and (2) provide an ongoing, comparative pool for career tracking and for evaluation, whether by CASS, outside evaluators, or disgruntled candidates.\n11. Consider the creation of a more structured leadership training component. Leadership training is an important aspect of CASS philosophy; what that means is appropriately variable, given the variety of technical fields.\n12. Review policies about the selection of host families, especially with respect to the language spoken in the home.\n13. Review whether some state or college regulations may lessen program impact.\n14. Explore methods to strengthen or build long-term linkages between participating U.S. and Latin American and Caribbean institutions and individuals.",

      "Key Findings": "1. CGIAR - Consultative Group for International Agricultural\nResearch is highly regarded for its effectiveness.\n2. CORAF/WECARD -West and Central African Council for Agriculture Research and Development\n\n3. The two documents chiefly consulted (The West Africa NRM\nInterCRSP of unknown provenance and the NRM InterCRSP Project in West Africa: a Synthesis\nof Four and One-Half Years of Field work) depict a rigorously conceived and executed\ncollaborative effort of adaptive research both on technologies and methods of supporting\nadaptation and adoption by farmers. The former provides a list of positive and negative lessons\nlearned in the process as well as proposed improvements to be built into future efforts following\non the conclusion of the current phase in March 2003\n4. TARGET (Technology Applications for Rural Growth and\nEconomic Transformation)/IARC (International Agricultural Research Centers): IARCs were invited to submit Concept Notes (CN) describing opportunities and approaches to realizing them in Africa. This produced 35 CNs from 16 IARCS, of which 11 belonged to CGIAR. The reviewer team thought the quality of the CNs was fairly good overall. There were more that merited funding than could be accommodated. CORAF’s comments, which were forwarded along with most of the final CNs, were valuable.\n5. WARP (West Africa Regional Program): An SO-6 success story indicates that the average yield increases achieved for sorghum, maize and cowpeas were 25%, 26% and 23%, respectively, and that some 700 farmers benefited, including some who qualified as food insecure.\n6. West and Central Africa Maize Collaborative Research Network\n(WECAMAN): AR covers year ending 9/30/02 and most results are for 2001. Field days held in Nigeria, Togo, Chad and Cameroon; On-farm tests and demonstrations held in Ghana, Nigeria, Mali, Togo, Benin, Burkina Faso, Nigeria, Senegal, Chad and Cameroon. This led to release or the earmarking for release of new varieties in Togo and Nigeria and to significant sounding findings in most of the other cases. WECAMAN funds community seed production schemes. Despite cited problems in performance and NARS reporting, these produced 4, 084 kg of breeder seed, 23, 547 kg of foundation seed and 202,054 kg of Certified seed in Nigeria, Ghana, Senegal, Mali, Cameroon, Chad and Benin. These need to be converted into microenterprises of the participating farmers. The AR calls for an impact assessment of this program element. Two each lead member countries were designated for research on four constraints, and the results achieved by each are summarized. Regional uniform variety trials of four varieties in 12 countries are reported in terse detail. Competitive grants funded agronomic practices. Trials by\nfour of the seven designated lead NARS are summarized in useful detail. NARS capacity building involved 5 consultation visits, three visiting scientist trainings, attendance by six technicians at a five month course at IITA Ferkessedougou, Cote d’Ivoire and (with special USAID funding of $30,000) a workshop on biotechnology. Demand expansion was pursued with sensory tests for suitability for use in biscuits, beignets, pancakes and “soumbian”. Scientists in Mali supported the development of a maize syrup and a composite flour.\n7. ROCARIZ (Réseau Ouest et Centre Africain du Riz/ West and\nCentral Africa Rice Research and Development Network): The ANRE Annual Report for 2001 notes that the number of “new technologies” promoted in rice declined slightly during recent years. Sidi Samyang document (circa 02) made no mention of technologies released or earmarked for release. The April 02 Newsletter notes that no activity was conducted under the Technology Transfer TF because the Technology Transfer Scientist was “not in place.” A total of 78 projects were funded in 2000, but by 2001 only 67 projects were operating. The number of scientists collaborating with ROCARIZ dropped from 68 in 2000 to 59 in 2001. The Monitoring Tour 2001 revealed that there is “generally weak in-country coordination of outreach programs, because of lack of funding.” However it found that “relevant rice-based technologies are being tested/promoted with farmers.” Two trainees from NARS completed internships on “anther culture and molecular biology” and ten participants were trained in impact assessment. The Second Biennial Regional Rice Research Review was held during April 9-12, 2002. Over 73 rice research and development papers were presented.\n8. West and Central Africa Sorghum Research Network\n(WCASRN):Document entitled Highlights of Achievements of WCASRN 1998- 2002. It reports, in particular, that: on-farm tests have led to the adoption of 31 varieties in nine countries with subsequent yield increases of over 2-3 MT/ha; IPM approaches targeted a head bugs, grain mold, anthracnose and Striga are stabilizing and increasing yields; use of cover crops has improved soil fertility, reduced soil degradation and increased sorghum yields; development of seed production; distribution systems have led to a substantial increase in farmer seed banks of improved varieties; following consumer preference studies three sorghum food products are now commercially available (sorghum biscuit, couscous and “deli’ken”). Most of the specific reports of above results are dated 2000. Report notes that plans had been based on an expected annual\nbudget of $500,000, but that they never received more than $250,000 during the plan period and\nthat this was a problem.",

      "Document Title": "Evaluation of Education Network (EdNet) Project",
      "Key Findings": "The project was evaluated in terms of (1) the effectiveness of the EdNet project in achieving intended results in the area of networking; (2) the impact of EdNet activity on the development of higher education in Central Asia: (3) lessons learned from the nationwide testing initiative in Kyrgyzstan and (4) the issue of EdNet sustainability.\n1. The EdNet project has achieved significant results in terms of institutional members. and enhancing meaningful networking among member institutions and their faculty members. The level of intellectual exchange among HEIs in the region has grown demonstrably. and information collected from system participants supports the conclusion that EdNet seminars, conferences and other learning events have strengthened the economics and business departments in the region. The membership size remains an issue. but the issue is amenable to analysis, given the available membership data and the near-term objectives of the EdSet project.\n2. The most significant EdNet achievements are to be found in the efforts to improve teaching by helping faculty learn new content and new teaching skills. EdNet has provided an extensive array of educational services - educational materials, grants for economic research. case writing competitions, training in the EdNet Academy, and Visiting International Professors (VIPs). Survey results from both EdNet institutional representatives and faculty members indicated that\nall of the services have been useful and have contributed to improvements in teaching and research in business and economics departments.\n3. EdNet no longer has responsibility for the testing program in\nKyrgyzstan. The program will continue under the direction of another contractor. However. the initial phases of the initiative have been considered very successful, and all respondents (with one exception) indicated that testing was extremely important to future of education in Kyrgyzstan. Turkmenistan was deemed the least likely to implement such an initiative. Tajikistan and Uzbekistan were considered only somewhat likely to succeed.\n4. EdNet sustainability is a big issue. Although EdNet objectives can and have been largely achieved, it is necessary to review organizational and financial options that will assist in the continuation of the project after the cessation of USAID. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Provide more support to ENA faculty after they complete their coursework. During interviews with several EdNet institutional representatives, it was suggested that there should be more follow-on activities for graduates of the EdNet Academy. As noted in questionnaire responses, the training received is very important, and highly valued by the participant and their home institutions. However, equally (and perhaps more) important is access to information needed for course development activities.\n2. Some journal subscriptions to EdNet institutions departments of business and economics are highly recommended. Most business and economics disciplines now have journals devoted to the pedagogical aspects of the discipline. For example, the Financial Management Association (FMA) publishes a quarterly journal entitled Financial Education.\n3. Expand organizational and financial support for activities designed to support the development of academic accreditation under international standards. The Central Asian Management Development Association (CAMAN) has widely publicized its accreditation activities. However, available budget information and conversations with people who are familiar with the accreditation situation in the CAR, suggest that EdNet has provided much of the funding necessary to encourage accreditation and international standards in the region.\n4. Increase systematic and active interaction with the major business economics associations in Western Europe and the CEENIS regions. Many members of the EdNet staff are familiar with the organizations that are conducting educational development activities similar to EdNet. The organizations include: (1) Central and East European\nManagement Development Association (CEEMAN) in Slovenia: (2) Russian Association of Business Education (RABE) in Moscow: (3) Ukrainian Association of Management Development and Business and Education IUAMDBE) in Kyiv.\n5. Encourage EdNet institutional members to develop institutional websites and inform them how they can be added to the \"Braintrack\" website. The site has hotlinks to most universities in the world, listed by country. An advantage of the listing is that fortuitous links with international universities can be established.\n6. Review and reduce the role of EdNet as a supplier of books, cases, computers, and other physical materials, and expand its role as a virtual supplier of information and resources to business and economics programs in the region. The need for intellectual resources and equipment in the region is massive, and the financial ability of EdNet to supply these items in the near future will be limited. Rather than acting as a \"wholesaler\" in the movement of educational materials from the source to the EdKet members. devote more resources to identifying and storing relevant information on the EdNet website.\n7. Expand computer training and internet access to individual business and economics faculty in the region. If the expanded roles of the EdNet website and the EdNet mailing list are to be effective, it will be necessary to support the development of access and search skills to locate and use the EdNet material and to find other relevant material on the internet.",

      "Key Findings": "SMEs play a key role in transition and developing countries. These firms typically account for more than 90% of all firms outside the agricultural sector, constitute a major source of employment and generate significant domestic and export earnings. As such, SME development emerges as a key instrument in poverty reduction efforts.\n\nGlobalization and trade liberalization have ushered in new opportunities as well as challenges for SMEs. Presently, only a small part of the SME sector is able to identify and exploit these opportunities and deal with the challenges. The majority of SMEs in developing and transition countries, however, have been less able or unable to exploit the benefits of globalization and, to add to the situation, are frequently under pressure on the local or domestic markets from cheaper imports and foreign competition. A major objective of work to promote the development of the SME sector is therefore to change the balance between these two groups of SMEs and to equip SMEs to better meet the challenges of globalization and to benefit from its opportunities.\n\nSMEs, due to their size, are particularly constrained by non-competitive real exchange rates, limited access to finance, cumbersome bureaucratic procedures in setting up, operating, and growing a business, poor state of infrastructure, and lack of effective institutional structures. The removal of these constraints is a daunting task calling for holistic SME support, i.e. an enabling environment for SME development consisting of functioning macro, meso and micro level institutions.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Embed strategies toward the private sector and SMEs in countries’ broader national development and poverty reduction programmes. Encourage and help SME associations to participate effectively in national dialogues that help set the strategic frameworks for development, so that the contribution and the policy and support needs of SMEs are fully recognised as central to growth, employment and poverty reduction.\n2. Strengthen SME capacities to improve their competitiveness in domestic, regional and global markets. Encourage and support private sector associations and enterprises able to provide information on markets and standards, advice on strategies, and access to technology and innovation coupled with appropriate financing packages. Promote tools, such as value chain analysis, which enable entrepreneurs to see what problems and challenges they need to address within and beyond their own borders and what kind of partners they need to help them.\n3. Promote policy coherence at regional, national and international level. Work to support whole of government approaches so that trade and investment policies and standard setting are aligned with development co-operation objectives and policies. Support completion of the Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations, including a reduction of barriers to trade in manufacturing and agricultural sectors with major benefits and opportunities for developing countries.\n4. Maximise the spillover of management skills and knowledge from multi-national enterprises to local SMEs. Spillovers of knowledge and management skills to local firms are one of most critical benefits of foreign direct investment for host countries. Support policy frameworks and multi-national enterprise behaviour that facilitate such spillovers and better document real-world cases to increase public understanding of the contribution of foreign direct investment in progression of development.",

Outsourcing at least some technical support appears to be effective but requires both technical and management competence in the MoE that will be difficult to develop and maintain.\n\nThe innovations planned for the MoE should stretch but need not greatly exceed its capabilities to manage the innovation process\nJEI-led initiatives in monitoring and evaluation are essential and should be strengthened: increased input from teachers, students, and parents and more systematic and rigorous monitoring and evaluation are needed to accelerate the evaluation of technology models and improvement of content.\n\nThe JEI is likely to face serious challenges as it makes the transition from a high-profile WEF project to an operational NGO with continuing responsibilities for both technology innovation and for assisting public education officials with the scale up of the innovations. The JEI PMO is a small organization with enormous responsibilities to help meet the Kingdom’s objective of building a knowledge economy. At present no other Jordanian organization has the prominence, experience, and capacity to play this role. To achieve its mission the JEI will need continued high-level support, additional capacity, and the continued funding support of the Government of Jordan, private sector partners, and multilateral donors.",
      "Key Recommendations": "The following specific recommendations are recommended concerning scaling up from pilot models in Discovery Schools to full-scale deployment:\n\n1. Solve the most critical information technology management problems using simple, sustainable systems.\n2. Solve the human capacity issue for technical support by expanding the internship program to address weaknesses at the education directorate and central ICT Directorate levels.\n3. Prove these solutions work in Discovery Schools before scaling up.\n4. Develop a model for scaling up successful models and approaches using a strategy that fosters, rewards, and disseminates leadership and innovation at the school level.\n5. Institutionalize the process of improving e-content and innovating in the use of ICT in grades 1–12 in public school education, using the Discovery Schools as a test bed for future improvements and innovations.\n6. Expand public-private partnerships to include employers of knowledge workers.",

      "Document Title": "Final Evaluation: Afghanistan Higher Education Project (HEP)",
      "Key Findings": "The HEP project made powerful contributions towards improving the quality of instruction at Faculties of Education in 18 universities located around Afghanistan. In 2005, before HEP began, university professors did not have access to developments in their fields. The state of content knowledge was 25 years out of date. In 2012, most professors have access to the Internet and sufficient knowledge to be able to gather professional content from it, and are familiar with a range of teaching methods and approaches. HEP provided 16,860 person-by2\ntraining opportunities (some individuals are repeated in this number) in areas such as: pedagogy, leadership, institutional development, strategic planning, computer operations, English language, math and science, and training in preparation for study tours.\n\nThe HEP project was instrumental in the creation and development of three new academic programs: a Master’s in Education in Dari program at Kabul Education University, a Bachelor’s in Public Administration program for five Afghan universities, and a Master’s in Public Policy and Administration program at Kabul University.\n\nThe HEP project developed a cadre of 84 new education leaders by providing opportunities for qualified faculty members to earn Master’s Degrees. Nineteen Faculty of Education members earned Master’s Degrees in the United States, 12 at Indiana University Bloomington and seven at The University of Massachusetts Amherst. In addition, to date, 65 faculty members have graduated from the M.Ed. in Dari program at Kabul Education University (KEU). Of these 84 Master’s graduates, 22 were promoted after graduation into management positions in their universities, as Chancellors, Vice Chancellors, Deans, and Heads of Departments. In addition to these Master’s graduates, the KEU M.Ed. program currently has enrolled 22 students who have completed one year of instruction, and another 22 students who started their first year in March 2012, an additional 44 future education leaders in the making.\n\nFor the past three years, the HEP project has supported the development of a national quality assurance system for higher education at the Ministry of Higher Education based on international standards. This system includes: development of the National Higher Education Strategic Plan: 2010-2014; establishment of three high commissions – Higher Commission for Accreditation, Higher Commission for Organization of Master’s Programs, and Higher\nCommission for Curriculum Review and Revisions – to support quality assurance; the facilitation of strategic plan writing at the university level; development of university accreditation standards and oversight bodies; and development of a university self-assessment process, a preliminary step in the accreditation process.\n\nHEP’s greatest strengths lie in its ability to continuously create and implement high-quality activities focused on improving the quality of educational instruction and educational quality assurance systems, despite a context replete with logistical and security challenges. HEP’s\ngreatest weaknesses, which were project design flaws from the beginning, were its limited attention to studying the impact of specific project activities and its lack of planning for sustainability. HEP therefore finds itself, at the end of six years of outstanding effort, in the regrettable position of not being able to prove empirically the impact of its manifold accomplishments, and of searching for last-minute ways to sustain project activities.",
      "Key Recommendations": "A few key components of HEP are worth continued focused support, in order to continue the best work that has been done. Given the post-conflict reconstruction context of the HEP project, and the need to support leaders at the MoHE and institutions of higher education who are beginning to create Afghan-led change, a top priority for consolidating HEP’s accomplishments would be to document the human capacity built through the project and analyze how it can best be leveraged for the next phase of reconstruction work. This could include: organizational mapping, the drawing together of the Master’s degree graduates through an alumni association, and the incorporation of Key Trainers of Pedagogy and Key Trainers of Leadership into future university faculty training plans.\n\nSmall grants supporting quality and relevance could be offered in several key areas. To support the development of female Afghan education leaders, scholarship or training opportunities could be offered to them, perhaps in neighboring countries such as India. Support for inter-university study visits within Afghanistan, perhaps starting with the Master’s graduates, might foster cohesion and a united sense of purpose for future work\n\nFinally, there are other areas where limited resources might have disproportionate impact in the areas of access, equity, and management/governance. For example, approaches need to be developed to encourage female student participation and an increased number of female faculty members in higher education. The research available on this issue should be gathered and a principled plan developed to encourage and support more female participation. Specific institutions of higher education where the leaders appear to be making efforts in this direction should be rewarded for their initiative with focused resources being offered to support what each institution sees as its greatest needs in this area",

      "Document Title": "Mid‐term evaluation for Support for Economic Analysis Development in Indonesia (SEADI) Program, working with the National Development Planning Agency (Bappenas) under the Assistance Agreement Economic Growth Programs in Indonesia",
      "Key Findings": "A. Overall Contract Obligations: Results to Date (KPI Progress vs. Plan):\n1. The (Support for Economic Analysis Development – Indonesia) (SEADI) project overall, and all major components (Policy analysis/Advisory, Capacity building/training, and Grants) are now meeting (in many cases exceeding) all contract specified outputs and work plan activity/achievement indicators (Key Performance Indicators, KPIs).\n2. After a slow start due in large part to the multifaceted complexity of project design, virtually all targets are being met as evidenced by Quarterly Performance Management Plan (PMP)/M&E tracking data -- showing positive progress vs plan on all PMP performance indicators.\n3. Evidence to date gives reason for confidence that all Contract KPIs are likely to be significantly surpassed over the course of the full two-year + contract term within the bounds of funds allocated for each component.\n4. PhD and Masters Degree Scholarship awards initially presented a problem due to overseas/US study terms far exceeding SEADI’s short contract duration. This has been resolved via complementary contract mechanisms enabling funding after SEADI terminates in 2013.\n5. Formal legislative and policy changes at SEADI’s mid-point -- specific legal and regulatory outcomes attributable to SEADI direct support are limited to Bapepam LK in the drafting of:\n The new insurance law,\n The new non-bank financial institutions laws, and\n New regulations for implementing the International Financial Reporting System.\n6. SEADI’s work on labor policy/laws at Bappenas are at an earlier stage of preliminary study prior to formulation of specific new laws or regulations. However, SEADI is actively supporting work on these issues.\n7. At the Ministry of Trade, SEADI is contributing to implementation of the Indonesian National Trade Repository.\n\nB. Performance of Advisors (Counterpart Engagement):\n1. The imbedded advisors are developing productive, strategic relationships with their key counterparts. They are serving them well, responsively, providing numerous modes of value adding support -- and in the process -- cultivating invaluable assets for deepening USAID\nengagement going forward.\n2. Among the four primary SEADI counterparts, the Ministry of Trade and Bapepam have engaged SEADI more comprehensively in supporting their respective agendas in global integration and regulatory reform.\n3. At Bappenas SEADI is engaged productively by virtue of an effective advisory relationship and an array of (some young) ministry counterparts. There are differing views regarding Bappenas’ value, role/power, and future (or lack thereof) in driving economic reform -- given its status as a national planning agency without budget leverage.\n4. The TNP2K/Poverty unit -- all the counterparts -- is the most opaque, enigmatic, and questionable in terms of gaining traction.\n\nC. Performance of SEADI Staff:\n1. The work of SEADI Short-Term Experts (STTA) is generally highly rated.\n2. The positive SEADI assessment factors, taken collectively (quantitative and qualitative), reflect varying degrees of excellence in team leadership, advisor and technical capabilities, staff support, and the mobilization of very competent short-term expertise.\n3. The performance of the COP has been excellent in many regards, given the range of challenges/complexities posed by project design, multiple GOI factors, and compressed timeframes.\n\nD. USAID/Project Process:\nThe USAID role of SEADI COR (Contracting Officer’s Representative) has seen relatively frequent turnover up to the recent appointment of the third and current COR. Although all CORs have been highly regarded, their other non-SEADI responsibilities and brief duration as COR have left SEADI without optimal and sustained\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. USAID should maintain a clear consistent commitment to SEADI over the coming year to avoid stakeholder/counterpart uncertainties, loss of their psychic investment, and diminishing project momentum.\n2. SEADI should consider shifting more research grant awards toward\nmeaningful pilot projects. The two main awardees thus far have shown how pilot projects can develop new (and practically applicable) models of public/private sector initiative -- with greater potential for nearer-term tangible impact during SEADI’s duration than simply more\nresearch.\n3 USAID seriously should consider additional investment in SEADI over its second year based on positive evidence of SEADI’s performance, the quality of staff, the value/potential of “relational equity” developed, and the strategic intervention opportunities available.\n4. SEADI (and USAID COR) should immediately explore a range of other possible second-year initiatives/options such as Infrastructure and PPP planning and financing modalities, training opportunities and\nstudy tours, and off-site workshop requests. It follows logically that some also have ongoing relevance for consideration in post-SEADI follow-on planning. ",

      "Document Title": "Merit and Needs-Based Scholarship Program (MNBSP) Evaluation Report",
      "Key Findings": "1. The program provided scholarships to 1,807 students, 1,195 of whom have graduated to date. Accounting for estimated dropouts, about 1,604 (1,243 men and 361 women) students will receive Merit and Needs-Based Scholarship Program (MNBSP) -supported degrees. Few scholarship recipients could have financed their education from personal resources. A majority (96 percent) of a sample of 605 alumni and current students who provided data reported that they would not have been able to continue their education without the MNBSP scholarship, a different scholarship, or a loan. Only three percent reported that they could have financed their degrees from personal resources.\n2. Most scholarship recipients (89 percent) understood that the U.S. provided the funding for the MNBSP. Furthermore, large majorities of MNBSP scholarship recipients view the U.S. and the American people favorably (74 percent and 84 percent, respectively) and they are much more likely than Pakistanis in general to have a favorable view the U.S.\n3. The MNBSP focus on agriculture is consistent with the expressed priorities of HEC (Higher Education Commission) as articulated in the Medium Term Development Framework (MTDF). However, neither the MTDF nor HEC officials mentioned scholarships supporting study in business as a high priority.\n4. MNBSP has met most, but not all, of its planned output and outcome targets. The program met its target for scholarship awards but did not meet targets for degrees awarded (because the targets did not account for dropouts.) The program has not yet achieved the target for female participation or for developing an online application system.\n5. Achieving the target of 25 percent female participation may require special efforts to publicize the program among prospective female students and/or consideration to increase female participation from urban areas.\n6. Participating universities do appear to be implementing the MNBSP selection process in a transparent manner and in accordance with the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). The combination of objective and subjective criteria appears to be an effective approach to identifying truly needy students and the universities are applying the criteria transparently.\n7. Recipients of MNBSP scholarships overwhelmingly graduated on time. The low incidence of delayed graduation is consistent with the incidence of delays among the entire student body.\n8. A substantial number of MNBSP scholarship recipients (alumni as well as current students) were dissatisfied with the payment process – largely due to delayed payments. Delayed payments caused significant hardship to these students with limited financial resources to meet expenses.\n9. The MNBSP scholars have performed reasonably well academically, and this academic performance may be significant when viewed from the perspective of their relatively weak academic backgrounds as a result of attending public sector institutions located in remote areas.\n10. The university officials viewed the prospects of MNBSP scholars progressing in their professions at par with the rest of the students.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. In consultation with HEC, reconsider the fields of study and the allocation of scholarships across supported fields of study in future scholarship programs. Scholarships in business administration are not consistent with current HEC priorities as articulated in the MTDF. However, scholarships in business support other HEC initiatives such as small business innovation research grants; the office of research, innovation and commercialization; and business incubation centers. The MTDF also emphasizes study in scientific, technological and engineering fields that are not covered under the current MNBSP.\n\n2. Increase outreach to women. Achieving the target of 25 percent female participation may require special efforts to publicize the program among prospective female students and/or consideration to increase female participation from urban areas.\n3. Consider modifying eligibility criteria for women. If USAID desires to target female students from “remote/vulnerable” as opposed to “rural” areas, a more robust definition of “remote/vulnerable” may better serve this purpose. District-wise Human Development Index and/or Deprivation Indices can be the basis for defining “remote”/ “vulnerable”/”disadvantaged” areas.\n4. Identify and resolve causes of delayed payments. Improvements in the payment mechanism are required to minimize the significant hardships delayed payments currently cause scholarship recipients. USAID could influence the speed of payment by helping identify and resolve bottlenecks and by trying to influence policies at specific universities that require students to pay tuition even when the scholarship is delayed.\n5. Ensure that the scholarship covers all education expenses. The scholarship award should cover all education related expenses (e.g. research expenses) of the students and should be awarded for the entire duration of the degree program.",

      "Key Findings": "1. Through the First Cash Transfer, which was made in FY 2009-10, USAID provided US$45.00 million to support a total of 41 universities serving conflict-affected students. The support covered three areas: 1) budgetary shortfalls resulting from liabilities accrued when the GOP cut recurring grant funding to universities in FY 2007-08 and instituted a 20 percent increase in salaries for university employees without providing a corresponding increase in funding, 2) reductions in FY 2009-10 recurring grant funding, and 3) the lost revenue universities experienced when the GOP ordered universities to waive fees and tuition for IDP students.\n2. Through the Second Cash Transfer, USAID provided US$37.79 million for development grants to support a total of 44 projects at 19 universities. These activities included constructing or rehabilitating buildings and laboratories, equipping laboratories, and supporting faculty development by sending them for Ph.D. studies outside Pakistan. USAID support accounted for 23 percent of the total amount of development grants provided to the 19 recipient universities.\n3. The financial assistance to IDP students was provided to all IDP students and had no gender targets or objectives. Nevertheless, the assistance had gender implications in the sense that it benefited few women relative to men. The “inequity” in the distribution of assistance did not reflect a deliberate choice or a design flaw, but was entirely the result of women being underrepresented among IDP students relative to the student bodies at their universities as a whole.\n4. Faculty and students who use the labs and equipment benefit from their use. They provide practical training (thus enhancing students’ job prospects), strengthen existing academic programs, support new programs, facilitate accreditation, and help universities establish research links with the public and private sectors. The high quality, modern equipment enhanced the relevance of classroom learning as well as the level and types of research possible. Many of the universities had just received the labs and equipment prior to the evaluation, and therefore, some were not yet operational. Consequently, some universities may not have yet realized the full extent of the benefits.\n5. The cash transfers were instrumental in allowing universities to continue their key activities. Officials at all universities the team visited reported that funding constraints were negatively affecting their operations. The cash transfers were instrumental in allowing universities to maintain normal operations.\n6. Both cash transfers directly contributed to USAID’s anticipated results in education programming as articulated in DO 4: Improved Access to High Quality Education, IR 1.3: Increased Access to Scholarships, and IR 1.1: Improved Educational Facilities. USAID support of development grants at 19 universities improved educational facilities, including laboratories and equipment. The improvements enhanced the availability and quality of education and permitted some universities to gain accreditation or add new programs and degrees. The financial assistance to IDP students, even though it was provided without a means test, acted as a scholarship to students who were particularly at risk of disrupting their educations because of insurgent activities that may have displaced their families.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Recommendations for improving the visibility and effectiveness of USAID assistance include:\n1. Requiring recipients of assistance to more explicitly attribute the results of assistance to USAID.\n2. Requiring implementing partners and recipient institutions/organizations to maintain accounting records that can identify USAID’s assistance.\n3. Hire externally or budget for a public relations activity to promote USAID’s assistance, or organize launching events for faculty and students.\n4. Although not as much of an issue at the time the cash transfers were made, ultimately, an unreliable and limited electricity supply restricted the usefulness of USAID-funded laboratories and equipment. In the future, it may be useful to consider the relative costs of including a package of assistance aimed at addressing any potential anticipated obstacles (e.g., including generators) against the possible limited benefits of the equipment if these problems do indeed occur.\n5. Providing cash transfers to HEC appears to be an effective way of meeting USAID's higher education goals. HEC's deep knowledge of Pakistan's universities helped it to place the funds where they were needed most.",

The exchange visit component, in particular, has contributed to improved skills, and so has working with new equipment.\n2. Pakistani program participants believe that the program has also strengthened the capacity of the institutions where Pakistani researchers are based by investing in researchers’ skills, financing new laboratory equipment, and helping improve students’ research opportunities and the teaching imparted to them.\n3. The S&T Program has a strong thrust toward academic publications and conference presentations. Almost all of the grants have resulted in academic publications, most of the research work has been presented at international conferences, and the average output per grant is impressive: 5.2 publications and 7.1 conference presentations per project for the 73 phase 1-4 projects. Achievements such as these are associated with enhanced international recognition for Pakistani researchers and their partners; they are also achievements in Pakistan-U.S. collaboration.\n4. Improved skills among researchers and students represent human capital that will yield a flow of benefits in the future. Thus, these skills, supported by laboratory equipment that is maintained, can contribute to international standards research in the years to come. Sustainability of results will be enhanced wherever researchers receive follow-up grants from S&T and other sources (as many have among the researchers interviewed) and establish effective linkages with government and business entities (which a few of the interviewed researchers have done).\n5. The S&T Program is recognized by program participants as an avenue for mutual understanding and goodwill between researchers from Pakistan and the U.S. This recognition, combined with the involvement of researchers’ students in the program, the addition of laboratory equipment at Pakistani institutions, and continuing efforts by some Pakistani researchers to work with U.S. institutions, represents progress in collaboration between the Pakistani and U.S. research establishments.\n6. The benefits of S&T-funded research for business, government, and the general public have been limited and the program confronts challenges in generating such benefits. Researchers identified elements of the macro environment that limit impact beyond the research setting, but these elements are beyond the control of S&T. The evaluation also found that research projects are not designed (and not required to be designed) in partnership with the ultimate owners, sellers, and users of research products, an omission that can be rectified by the program.\n7. The program has also been unable to overcome some of the challenges to sustaining its results: there is little evidence that Pakistani researchers’ institutions have allocated resources for maintaining equipment, or introduced policies for sustaining research that harnesses improved researcher skills and institutional capacity. The program has not developed instruments for ensuring the sustained operation and maintenance of equipment.\n8. The S&T Program is avowedly merit-based and Principal Investigators (PIs) are expected to include women in their projects. In practice, women are included in S&T research to a limited extent, and this could be a reflection of male dominance in scientific research. The program has not introduced some of the means that are available for establishing more equal gender participation (outlined in the evaluation recommendations below).\n9. Funding, procurement, visa, and other problems have continued to affect researchers involved in the program for several years, and many of these problems lie beyond the control of the program. Significant problems in program management have evidently not been addressed in a systematic manner so far, although many researchers expressed the need for resolving them and the program managers in Pakistan felt that solutions are possible.",
      "Key Recommendations": "The evaluation offers four recommendations. Three of these can be implemented by modifying the grant award process to enable the S&T Program to generate greater practical benefits, better sustain results, and include more women in program activities. The fourth recommendation concerns timely project performance.\nIt is recommended that the grant award process be modified in three ways to reflect the following suggestions:\n\n1. The S&T Program objectives are aimed at both basic and applied research, the latter including research that spurs economic development and supports industry competitiveness. The program should add three methods for encouraging applied research to the grant announcement, proposal, and selection processes. These recommended measures are: (a) clarify in the request for proposals how the program intends to promote applied research; (b) require researchers interested in applied research to demonstrate partnerships at the proposal/application stage with specific business and government entities for which they intend to produce certain products or solutions; and provide written confirmation of common objectives and contribution from such entities. In other words, proposals should describe not only partnerships between U.S. and Pakistani researchers, but also between researchers and the end-users of the proposed research. Research intended to benefit communities (for example, farmers, home builders, patients, and water users) should also be proposed as partnerships between researchers and relevant service providers in the public or private sector (from example, government line departments and regulatory agencies or private manufacturers and organizations that represent community groups); and (c) give bonus points during the grant selection process to proposals/applications that demonstrate promising partnerships with or for the end users.\n2. The S&T Program should require Pakistani researchers who include equipment in their proposals to submit plans for the sustainable operation and maintenance of the equipment, including their institutions’ written commitment to allocate the space, staff, and finances required for this purpose. In addition, USAID should request the Higher Education Commission of Pakistan to ensure that institutions that will own the equipment allocate the required staff and finances for its operation and maintenance before they purchase the equipment.\n3. The S&T Program should consider various options, in a stand-alone or mutually reinforcing mode, which could lead to greater inclusion of women in the program. One option is to specify a progressively increasing quota for female PIs in terms of the proportion of funding or number of grants. The quota could be for the program as a whole or for specified focus areas, including those (for example, agriculture) in which there are few women at present. Another option is to give weight or bonus points in the grant selection criteria to the number of women, including PIs, staff, and students, who will participate in the proposed research. A third option is to establish a support group consisting of program alumni that would seek out and mentor female grant applicants from Pakistan and the U.S. throughout the application and research process. In this scenario, the S&T Program should provide operational funds to support group members for their time, travel, communication, photocopying and similar costs during the application process. It could also arrange training in proposal development and grant management.",

      "Document Title": "Science, Technology, Research and Innovation for Development (STRIDE): Philippines Innovation Ecosystem Assessment",
      "Key Findings": "The assessment model and resultant scorecard are intended to highlight the complex interactions between supply, demand, and the enabling environment in each of the key areas comprising the innovation ecosystem. The assessment results emphasize the need for participatory solutions that address key challenges at the root causes and along the identified causal chains, and with an appreciation for the perspectives and experiences of all involved stakeholders.\n\nEach of the major issues reported by STRIDE—especially the cross-cutting chains of impacts— also invites solutions emanating from different domains of action. For example, procurement rules may need to be addressed at the legislative level, through specific and careful changes to Republic Act 9184, although there may also be scope for the Government Procurement Policy Board to define changes in implementing rules and regulations. Others are clearly a matter of departmental regulations, as in the case of DOST and CHED counterpart funding requirements. Still others may be more issues of culture than of policy, but will benefit from changes in formal practices from across the spectrum of organizations involved in the ecosystem.\n\nOur findings should also provide a modicum of caution even about the ability of key initiatives to provide “magic bullets” or quick fixes. There is consensus among stakeholders in favor of creating more PhDs, stimulating more public and private research funding, and bringing about more accurate costing of research overheads. Each of these is a necessary ingredient in the recipe for a stronger, more innovative university-based research system in the Philippines. Yet these efforts must be part of a holistic, stakeholder-led effort to build relationships, mutual understanding, and feedback loops that can make the system self-sustaining and self-correcting. The potential of a neutral consultative body of stakeholders such as P-GUIRR to support such efforts can be realized if it can be truly representative of the diversity of interests and perspectives in Philippine innovation.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Stakeholders can promote better sharing of success stories through P-GUIRR and other public dialog mechanisms and can encourage spending on R&D through institutions. They can also work to create alternative narratives and showcase win-wins, for example, celebrating Balik/returnee scientists who have successfully engaged in creating commercial ventures in partnership with the private sector, and revealing the specific financial terms of these relationships to the extent possible, in order to adjust expectations. Stakeholders should also work to develop (voluntary) national revenue-sharing guidelines and protocols outlining reasonable university-industry revenue-sharing arrangements for each type and phase of research to provide guidance and “political cover” to administrators and researchers engaged in developing public-private partnerships.",

      "Key Findings": "This report is about different PEER projects and their potential impacts. Here are the short details of the project objectives and potential impacts:\n\nBuilding Tools for Policymakers in Asia to Combat Air Pollution and Climate Change:\nThis project is building climate databases and emission models needed by policymakers in Asia to craft an effective emission reduction policy. All three institutions in Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam collaborating on this project have begun developing action plans for emission reduction policy. These action plans will help save millions of lives and crops while taking on climate change. The project's team is already engaged with government agencies in all three countries, sharing data and information.\n\nExpanding Educational Access for Deaf Students:\nThis project is building assistive technology for deaf and hard-of-hearing people. The computer technology functions as an instructional tool and as a real-time translation system between Modern Standard Arabic and Moroccan Sign Language. This project has built a PEER partnership with a scientist at Vinopol of the Institute for Disabilities Research and Training (IDRT), a small company located in the U.S. state of Maryland. IDRT has particular expertise in the development of American Sign Language-accessible computer software and other assistive technology products\n\nDNA Barcoding to Protect Fish Species in Indonesia:\nIn partnership with Dr. Kent Carpenter of Old Dominion University in the U.S. state of Virginia, this peer PEER project is focusing on fish genetics, especially shark and tuna. The team's study of tuna and sharks using state-of-the-art technology Will provide scientific data to the government and policymakers. The project using can provide managers and enforcement agencies an essential tool to monitor shark fisheries and prosecute individuals participating in the sale of prohibited species.\n\nImpacts of Climate Change on Wetlands in Colombia:\nThis project offers the collected information from the (weather) stations to create public awareness of the importance of having this kind of information publicly available and to promote support for these initiatives in similar projects in the country.\n\nEffective Erosion Control in the Blue Nile Basin:\nThe PEER project works directly with the communities in three watersheds, and the researchers have met and planned their projects with community and district leaders. An exciting component of the PEER grant is the establishment of a new Ph.D. program in Integrated Water Management at the School of Civil and Water Resources Engineering at Bahir Dar University. The Ph.D. curriculum, developed by integrating programs from Cornell University and Bahir Dar University, is the university's first program in Integrated Water Management. This new Ph.D. program will help prepare a cadre of future scientists to tackle water and land use issues in Ethiopia-issues that are key to the country's agricultural and economic future.\n\nReduced Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Livelihoods in Vietnam:\nThis PEER project is to contribute to policy-relevant knowledge on social vulnerability to climate change in Vietnam by providing a baseline to explain variations in the expected performance of possible REDD+ approaches. The team sees its work going beyond Vietnam to other countries in Southeast Asia.\n\nRollout of a Preventive Drug Treatment Regimen for Malaria in Mali:\nThe anticipated outcome of the study will be a qualified optimal approach to deliver SMC in Mali and expanded understanding of its impact on health outcomes and antimalarial immunity. The strategy is a highly cost-effective approach to reduce childhood mortality in these areas. Implementation studies are now urgently needed to identify the most effective and efficient methods to deliver SMC. The optimal strategy will prevent approximately 75 percent of all malaria episodes, and approximately 75 percent of severe malaria episodes each year, resulting in many lives saved. \n\nPreventing Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV in Malawi:\nThe project will integrate a vast and decentralized health registry across the health services and generate a central data repository for those seeking HIV treatment in Malawi. The project will also inform the public about the impact of Option B+ as well as future public health, policy, and practice in Malawi.\n\nPharmaCheck: A Tool to Improve Drug Quality in Indonesia:\nPharmaCheck, developed by researchers at Boston University, is an extremely user·friendly, reliable, cost-effective technology that screens for substandard drugs using active pharmaceutical ingredient concentration and drug dissolution tests. This project will demonstrate the prospects of using PharmaCheck in Indonesia and other developing countries to regularly test essential drugs at primary health care centers and hospitals.",

      "Document Title": "Wings to Fly Mid-term Performance Evaluation ",
      "Key Findings": "1. PEPFAR (President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief) OVC (Orphans and Vulnerable Children) definitions have changed since the program began. In addition to being required to select PEPFAR OVC scholars, EGF (Equity Group Foundation) was to select equal numbers of boys and girls, with 60 percent from Nyanza and Rift Valley provinces. In 2012, the 60 percent requirement was met. In 2013 EGF was to include 500 AIDS, Population, and Health Integrated Assistance Plus (APHIAplus) scholars, but included only 201, with 299 additional scholars reportedly from areas of high HIV prevalence also included. Of all USAID secondary scholars, 49.6 percent are girls and 50.4 percent are boys.\n2. EGF has had no general manager (GM) for monitoring and evaluation (M&E) for over a year and a half and had short-term staffing in that position previously. It is currently without a GM for education and leadership. While much data is gathered and reported upon, WtF (Wings to Fly) M&E policies and procedures have not been formalized. A contract with Kimetrica has produced a draft M&E framework to address this deficit. Certain M&E database fields (e.g., scholars’ home district) need substantial cleaning and currently prevent district-level analysis. FY 2014 quarterly reports show underspending by more than $570,000 each quarter and an average burn rate of 65 percent.\n3. WtF aligns with USAID’s Country Development Cooperation Strategy (CDCS) under DO2, IR 2.2, and its various sub-IRs. WtF is scheduled to end Nov. 9, 2016, and current USAID and PEPFAR requirements will remain applicable until then or until changed and approved by USAID. Future decisions (e.g., concerning funding sources, definition of terms, services offered, outcome emphasized) will determine if USAID will use current or revised indicators beyond that date. PEPFAR funds require continued use of two current indicators, including psychosocial support. EGF’s M&E does not yet support accurate reporting of all required indicators.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1) Three definitions to address: USAID should confirm the applicable definition of “OVC” and the permitted beneficiaries in WtF under PEPFAR funding. It should also clearly define “psychosocial support” and identify or confirm the types of WtF services and OVCs that may be counted and reported under this indicator (PEPFAR C5.6.D). It should also confirm with EGF the operative definition(s) of “mentoring” and what types of WtF mentoring activities may be counted and reported under which indicators. Examples include a) distinguishing “school-based” from all other mentoring types and large-group motivation sessions (DSSB) from individualized or small-group sessions and b) possibly disqualifying Annual Congress meetings as sufficient for reported mentoring unless small-group or individualized mentoring takes place there and is documented. USAID should also establish whether school-based mentoring visits for all WtF scholars constitute instances of “psychosocial support” for PMP reporting and whether this would be more warranted if Healthy Choices content is delivered during those visits.\n2) For retrospective reporting, USAID should clarify with EGF the geographic requirement that was operating for scholars to be drawn from Nyanza and Rift Valley provinces.\n3) If further PEPFAR funds are granted, USAID should emphasize selection of HIV-affected candidates for WtF, possibly through renewing the requirement for involvement from the APHIAplus program.\n4) Recalling that EGF has indicated that Healthy Choices likely requires them to reprogram their budget, after EGF considers this report, USAID should meet with them to discuss reprogramming. EGF has an opportunity now to rebudget a range of USAID WtF activities to address any operational issues and accommodate any new plans for decentralizing, M&E staffing, alumni association service development, etc., and to bring its quarterly and annual budgets more in line with actual spending.\n5) When reprogramming the budget or when obligating further funds, USAID should consider reinforcing or complementing any post-graduate (secondary)/alumni support activities that EGF is undertaking with KfW. This would support EGF in further assisting WtF graduates who do not gain direct admission to government institutions of higher education, and better assess the long-term outcomes, impact and value of its investment in WtF.\n6) USAID should communicate new M&E requirements to EGF, given the new CDCS results framework, and confirm or revise existing indicators or develop new ones for any ongoing, reprogrammed or new activities. Additional indicators are likely needed to track certain desired WtF outcomes (particularly CDCS-relevant ones) that are now developing or are likely to develop. For example: 1) activities supporting DO2 sub-IRs 2.2.2 and 2.2.3, as these sub-IRs focus on county involvement, accountability, leadership, service delivery, ownership (e.g., leveraged financial and in-kind resources for awarding additional scholarships; number of scholars funded from private sources; number funded by county governments; number of committees from “remote districts” that help inform applicants to apply to WtF, etc.), and 2) tracking of and services for mid-level WtF graduates related to their quests for higher education (e.g., number of scholars receiving college and career counseling, number of letters of reference sent to HELB in support of scholars’ applications for HELB loans, number of enrollments to tertiary institutions verified by scholars’ student identifications, etc.). PMP indicators and most recent PIRS are shown in relation in Annex 25 with comments and suggested additional terms to improve utility.\n7) USAID should require that EGF use the PMP reporting grid at regular intervals and do so using real figures for actual service numbers delivered in the period and cumulatively. USAID should train EGF staff in this simple reporting format to ensure compliance.\n8) Independent of PMP/PIRS requirements, USAID should require EGF to continue to report aggregate scholar grades, though this can be reduced in frequency from quarterly or per term to annually at the end of the academic year as part of the first calendar quarter report.\nFor EGF: Note: The numerous and detailed recommendations for EGF are in Annex 1. Below we present a few priority recommendations and urge study of the full set.\n9) To compensate for the centralizing tendency of the WtF design, in consultation with the MOEST and donors, re-examine WtF’s current approach to allocating additional scholarships to county branches.\n10) As long as PEPFAR remains a WtF funder, EGF should amplify its emphasis on HIV-affected candidates during scholar selection and emphasize HIV education for all secondary scholars. Involving APHIAplus in the selection process as members of DSSBs is one way to make such an emphasis more likely.\nFor EGF: Recommendation Related to Successes and Challenges (Q2)\n11) Complete the M&E framework design and implement any revisions to data capture, query and reporting systems and the monitoring processes themselves system-wide.\n12) WtF should immediately implement the WtF alumni association to try to keep graduates engaged so their futures can be known and the long-term impact and value of WtF better understood.\nFor EGF: Recommendation Related to Reporting and Monitoring (Q3)\n12) Confirm/revise current PMP and PIRS indicators and align them with the CDCS. Existing PMP indicators are adequate with adjustments as suggested in Annex 8 – PMP-PIRS Table, and adopt a rigorous approach to PMP quantitative reporting using the PMP reporting grid.\n6) Work with USAID to develop any new indicators aligned with the CDCS that may be needed for existing, new or reprogrammed activities.",

      "Document Title": "Rethinking the design paradigm for university technology projects in international development",
      "Key Findings": "1. The findings from the analysis suggest that the following aspects of graduate-level projects might be approached differently: (1) early-stage planning, (2) contextualization of the technology focus, (3) project timescales, and (4) the intent of community engagement.\n2. In the case studies, the planning phase of the product development process occurred in creating the funding proposal for the projects and significantly influenced the subsequent stages. As such, more consideration might be given during planning to better identify a\nmarket opportunity, to manage the tension between the descriptive research goals and the normative design goals, and to determine the range of flexibility a project might have to adjust to a dynamic problem given its more rigid resources. The case studies highlighted a tendency to prioritize technology over context, reflecting the strengths and interests of the project teams. However, the literature suggests that in designing remotely for the \"developing world,\" challenges arise when users are not well understood and when the ecosystem within which a product is distributed is not fully considered. With regards to time as a resource constraint, the cases showed time pressures specific to the graduate-level projects. Academic commitments limited opportunities to travel and therefore limited the scope of the project work and the timescales and lifetime of a graduate degree or project did not match the time required for development to occur within a community. Lastly, in exploring the project teams' engagements with resource-constrained communities, the analysis suggested an ethical framework in which community members were not solely an information point, but were the reason the projects existed and a guiding factor for how the projects could be run.\n3. The product development process may be useful as a structured framework for not only modeling and analyzing this catalog of projects but also improving the process.\n4. In academic international development projects, universities/students are asked to not only produce research but also develop products. However, university graduate programs do not typically produce products-but they do produce learning, research, and new technology.\n5. Technology-based research in-and-of-itself should not be a means for claiming innovation within the international development practice. Likewise, poverty alleviation should not be a means for creating compelling research programs. The ideal state occurs when both the academic and community impact are never considered merely means, but as the mutual and equal ends in themselves.",

      "Key Findings": "1. Higher education strengthening refers to capacity building within the host country's higher education institutions. Stakeholders addressed higher education strengthening in diverse ways; however, across partnerships, there was emphasis related to teaching, research, and extension. For example, shifts in teaching methods and the development of new types of curricula were primary themes related to the development of undergraduate and graduate programs at the host institutions. When discussing teaching, both U.S. and host country stakeholders across partnerships described improvements as a shift from rote learning and lectures to greater engagement between students and faculty in the classroom as well as curriculum designed with a clearer connection to market needs. \n2. Improved educational effectiveness also appeared to have a strong link to institutional development in terms of human resources (e.g. faculty development), access to material resources (e.g. textbooks), and improved technology resources/infrastructure. While some partnerships focused on change primarily within the program/department that was directly linked to the partnership, it is important to note that there were instances where these practices flowed over into other programs, departments, or even other institutions within a host country.\n3. Improved research capacity was also present, although the emphasis on this area of strengthening varied more across partnerships than educational effectiveness, with Albania partner stakeholders engaging in the most discussion about this area of strengthening. Additionally, this area appeared to reflect the research engagement of individual stakeholders (particularly between U.S. and host country stakeholders) more so than at a program, department, or institution level.\n4. Extension and outreach emphasized non-formal education within local communities. Across partnerships, this form of strengthening appeared to be the most complex, as it required engagement and alliances both within and beyond the walls of the host country's higher education institution.\n5. The development of institutional capacity building at host country institutions provided stakeholders with the ability to also make contributions to larger society within host countries in both the short and long term. However, as partners described higher education impact, they often did so in conjunction with descriptions of higher education strengthening, which suggests that the two are interdependent. For example, partners discussed the creation of a highly-skilled workforce as being driven by a strong academic curriculum",

Treated firms are more likely to switch suppliers and have lower inventory costs, highlighting the importance of cost and supplier information. The benefits are driven by the flow of information rather than a permanent change in practices, as the study shows that the effect fades most among those whose matches dissolve earliest. The study exploits the selection procedure with a regression discontinuity design to show that no observable benefits extend to the more successful, older firm in the match. Finally, the study benchmarks this treatment against a standard microenterprise training program. Training generates changes in business practices covered in the classes but no change in profit, consistent with previous work.",

      "Key Findings": "The theory of change includes monitoring, evaluation, and learning system that combines indicators of progress in research along with indicators of change aimed at understanding the factors that enable or inhibit the behavioral changes that can bring about development impacts. Theory of change represents our best understanding of how engagement and learning can enable change as well as how progress towards outcomes might be measured. Although robust evidence is currently lacking, a theory of change approach appears to have considerable potential to achieve impacts that balance the drive to generate new knowledge in agricultural research with the priorities and urgency of the users and beneficiaries of research results, helping to bridge the gap between knowledge generation and development outcomes.\n\nStrong incentives from funding agencies for a move towards\noutcome-oriented research programs are having a considerable impact on the way in which agricultural research is conceived, planned, implemented, and evaluated. A key requirement for such work is flexibility - the flexibility to adjust so that the outcome orientation works as a support mechanism and enabler rather than a one-size-fits-all straitjacket without space for innovation, serendipity, and creativity. The shift to an AR4D approach based on the theory of change is fostering real transition in the international agricultural research community, much of it for the better in our view. However, it also comes with considerable challenges.",

      "Key Findings": "With regard to the capacity to innovate, the study observed that all three Multi-stakeholder platforms (MSPs) networks are dominated by NGOs with an apparent lack of involvement of the business sector. The dominance of development organizations and lack of entrepreneurial capacity in these networks may hinder social learning and the development of innovations that are commercial and respond to end-user needs. Knowledge plays an important role in the innovation network and the amount of knowledge exchange is positively correlated with the number of collaborative ties an organization has within the innovation network. In DRC and Burundi, the decentralized governance structure seems to create a problem in that MSPs are not strongly linked to the most influential agencies, which could negatively affect their legitimacy and create obstacles for achieving institutional (policy) innovations and upscaling for impact.\n\nThe MSP networks are dominated by supranational and national organizations, whereas local organizations were mostly absent. Such networks are thus less geared towards the outscaling of knowledge-intensive innovation and their local adaptation to diverse end-users and environments. The study illustrates that MSP networks are diverse and context-specific,  propose that MSPs should not be used as blueprint vehicle for supporting innovation and scaling, but that more research is required to understand how the institutional setting (e.g. governance) and under-representation of certain actors (e.g. private sector) affect the ability of MSPs to stimulate capacity to innovate and achieving development impact at scale.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Continuous mapping of MSP networks over time will enable a longitudinal analysis of network evolution and also link it to the actual performance of the MSP with regard to achieving development impacts.\n2. More farmer and business representatives within the MSPT need to be included to ensure that innovation and scaling are more end-user inclusive. \n3. For DRC and Burundi, more attention to developing the knowledge exchange network is necessary in order to connect the different parts of the network (across hierarchies and spatial scales).",

      "Key Findings": "Central Asia region's (CAR) potential for science and technology (S&T)-based commerce and innovation has been restrained by decades of Soviet control, as well as by post-Soviet political fragmentation. New life abounds, however, as CAR S&T policies are in a phase of transition. In the years following independence in 1991, all governments in the region have taken up concrete measures to facilitate S&T progress and development. \n\nA number of S&T cooperative agreements were signed with neighboring countries following the Soviet Union's fall in 1991. Russia remains CAR's main S&T partner. Among others, however, the region's political situation (i.e., conflicts in Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan) influences strongly the level of scientific cooperation. Overall, regional cooperation is still driven by past (Soviet) personal or institutional links, though new initiatives have emerged over the past few years. One existing regional approach is the University of Central Asia, which operates in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan. UCA's goal is to link isolated areas with the global intellectual community in order to provide student-centered, innovative teaching and learning methods, and encourage critical thinking and leadership in its graduates.\n\nUSAID/Central Asia continues to strengthen its use of new technologies to better implement development programming, including \"mobile technology to increase access for vulnerable populations to TB and HIV services, piloting cold storage innovations developed by the Global Development Lab, and using geospatial data to better support performance monitoring and to improve the cross-border basin management between Tajikistan and Afghanistan.\" In addition to engaging the GDL to stay informed of new innovations, the mission's Regional Development Cooperation Strategy 2015-19 highlights the use of AGMIP (Agricultural Model and lntercomparison and Improvement Project) technologies for agriculture planning in the region to enhance climate change adaptation capacity.

Haibo Yao’s team at the US Department of Agriculture advanced their innovative spectral imaging strategy for low-cost aflatoxin detection, completing a prototype of the “aflabox” while also exploring new areas where this technology may be disruptive in low-cost monitoring of aflatoxin in maize.\nJS Wang’s lab at the University of Georgia was able to develop a method to use dried blood spots to detect aflatoxin exposure in human blood. \nKumar Mallikarjunan’s investigation of various detection methods and labs was able to confirm the detection limits of some novel technologies, as well as some potential issues with human error in accurate detection.\nFinally, while pediatrician Mark Manary’s study of a new Ready to Use food for malnourished mothers in Malawi was unable to produce significant birth outcomes as hoped, it did advance the knowledge of the treatment window for this important population.\n\nResearch along the peanut value chain:\nThe three large value chain projects varied greatly depending on the needs and opportunities in each country. Though different in structure, the randomized control trial in Ghana also advanced the knowledge of aflatoxin control measures in the value chain in Ghana.\n\nIn Haiti, Macdonald’s team was able to follow up with advances made with NGO and private sector partners, especially related to input technologies and variety evaluations, but also expanded to collaborate with universities, including 41 students successfully completing research projects.\nThe randomized control trial produced solid data on both the impact of technologies aimed at aflatoxin reduction and the potential likelihood of adoption under various scenarios. The project showed the difficulties of both conducting field-based aflatoxin research and the formal commercialization of the sector.\nThe Southern Africa value chain project in Malawi, Mozambique and Zambia, and the associated economic evaluation project overcame great initial challenges to establish a solid research network across universities, national programs, NGOs, and the private sector. Significant results were produced in each country, from basic to applied research and from production to consumption. \n\nCapacity Building:\nMore than 70 students received graduate degrees in a range of disciplines related to agronomy, food science, nutrition, or public health with PMIL support. Of those students, 53 studied at universities in their home country or region, further building higher education capacity within their university systems. Half of the graduate students were female. In addition to long-term training, the PMIL provided short-term training to 48 students.",

      "Document Title": "Community-driven development: does it build docial cohesion or infrastructure? A minsed-method evidence sysnthesis ",
      "Key Findings": "1. The impact of CDD programs:\nCDD programs improve facilities for education, health, and water. Investments in water-related infrastructure have reduced the time required for collecting water. These programs slightly improve health- and water-related outcomes, but not education outcomes.\n\n2. Community participation in CDD programs:\nThe entire community does not participate in all aspects of project management and implementation. There is a clear funnel of attrition. Many people may be aware of the program and the community meeting, but few attend the meeting and fewer still speak or participate in decision-making. Women are only half as likely as men to be aware of CDD programs, even less likely to attend the community meetings, and even less likely still to speak at them. Evidence suggests people may have participated in making bricks, not decisions.\n\nCDD programs may be using existing social cohesion rather than building it. Numerous factors may affect community involvement, such as the role played by the elite or prime movers in the community, intra-community divisions, and the perceived benefits of participation.\n\n3. Participation of marginalized people: Although CDD programs have included measures to improve the participation of marginalized people, there is no evidence regarding the impact of such measures. There is also no information about how program implementers facilitated the participation of different ethnic and religious groups living in a community.\n\nGendered cultural norms and socioeconomic factors can negatively influence women’s participation in the public sphere. Where female participation is a target, not a requirement, women’s participation usually falls short.\n\nNot many studies have carried out sex-disaggregated analysis of participation. Fewer still have assessed whether CDD programmes have empowered women to take a more active role in the public sphere, beyond the scope of the programme.\n\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. It may be better to abandon the CDD program objective of building social cohesion and focus on instead sustainable, cost-effective delivery of small-scale infrastructure.  \n2. Program Implementers need to assess if community members are willing or able to make contributions to development projects.\n3. Moving beyond the definition of community as a geographical administrative unit and considering different groups and gendered power relations in the community would be important for delivering more equitable programs.\n4. Since small-scale infrastructure is a major program output, implementers should pay attention to the technical, institutional, and financial mechanisms in place for ensuring that these facilities are maintained and operate properly. \n5. Designing CDD programs involves a number of decisions where various trade-offs need to be considered:\na. The institutional setup of the CDD agency, whether as an independent agency or as part of an existing ministry or department, influences the impact of program. There is a trade-off between the possible greater efficiency and flexibility of an independent agency and the greater government buy-in and sustainability of the processes implemented by an existing ministry. \nb. The choice between using an application-based model and allocation model should be informed by community capacity, financing and program target objectives. \nc. There is a trade-off between breadth and depth of coverage - reaching more communities or spending more in each. \n6. Social cohesion is a complex concept. Most impact evaluations have assessed both bonding social capital, such as trust and cooperation in the community, and bridging social capital such as social connectedness with authority. It would be important to consider the possible friction between these elements of social capital. \n7. Quantitative impact evaluations should assess the political economy of local decision-making or the different levels of existing social cohesion between sub-groups in a community.\n8. Evaluation should also examine how issues related to the type of institution involved in implementation, the targeting of communities, and the sustainability of arrangements influence program impact. Future studies also need to examine how factors such as grant size, continuity of funding, facilitation of community participation, and longer-term provision of training improve outcomes. ",

      "Key Findings": "1. Technology Development:\nMain bio-physical farming systems innovations of SIIL’s focus included: cereal/legume integration and rotations, especially in the semi-arid zone of West Africa; crop-livestock integration, especially in Ethiopia and Burkina Faso; and dry-season irrigated horticulture, under permanent-raised-bed conservation agriculture approaches, especially strong in Cambodia.\n2. Research on sustainable agriculture productivity and enhancing the resilience of cropping systems:\nIn each of the six host-countries, the stakeholders, especially national public and private sector organizations (including farmers) contributed to the problem and opportunity identification and to decisions on specific research components to be adapted to the local context and to be pilot tested in the field.\n3. Collaboration:\nSIIL’s Appropriate Scale Mechanization Consortium (ASMC), coordinated from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, is generally integrated into local-level research for development (R4D).\n4. Social Capital Development (SCD):\nSIIL has several elements of SCD elements that are rather opportunistically embedded in the field program, with wide-ranging thrusts from gender empowerment and farmer-to-farmer learning in vegetable and other horticulture production, including gender-specific mechanization considerations, to nutrition education and studies on the impact of quality diets on farm communities, such as in Tanzania.\n5. Capacity Building:\nSIIL is strongly committed to human and institutional capacity building, as evidenced by the number of short-term training offered to 4,336 individuals (1,550 women, 36%) and support of long-term graduate degree training to 60 individuals (22 females). Of the 60 individuals, 26 are pursuing a Ph.D. degree (35% females), 28 Masters of Science (43% females), and 6 undergraduate degrees.\n6. Management:\nThe ET found SIIL’s ME to be, overall, very sound and highly motivated with a high level of effectiveness. The SIIL Director is a well-respected scientist; this helps garner strong partnerships with general positive responsiveness.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Technology Development:\nSIIL ME budget for and organize workshops in Phase 1 to develop Impact Pathways for the innovations toward targeted country scaling up in alliance with other development partners, both national and international.\n2. Research on sustainable agriculture productivity and enhancing the resilience of cropping systems:\nIn Phase 1 a participatory appraisal of farm women, men, and youth’s evaluation of SI technologies in order to inform priorities for Phase 2.\n3. Collaboration: In Phase1 Appropriate Scale Mechanization Consortium (ASMC) can and should expand its efforts toward creating a digitized knowledge-archiving and sharing facility—functioning in-perpetuity—on specific technologies and their implementation for Appropriate Scale Mechanization (ASM) covering global innovations to reduce “re-invention of the wheel.\n4. Social Capital Development (SCD): ME fosters a cross-cutting assessment of the effectiveness of conventional and innovative social capital mechanisms in Phase 1 to guide investments in Phase 2.\n5. Capacity Building: Phase II should include specific training in systems approaches for faculty in African, Asian, and US universities working with SIIL students. \n6. Management: ME should seek to identify more effective means to reward, coerce or censure laggards as Phase 1 approaches completion.",

      "Document Title": "Final Report: External Evaluation Team of The Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Integrated Pest Management",
      "Key Findings": "1. Integrated Pest Management Innovation Lab (IPM IL) in consultation with the Missions in the participating countries and other stakeholders identifies the demands and addresses the problems using IPM technology. For example, at the request of USAID mission in Egypt IPM IL undertook a study on the spread of and food security risk due to Fall Army Worm (FAW).\n2. IPM IL has brought together the stakeholders through training workshops, farmer field days, planning meetings, annual review meetings, consultations, and seminars. The number of participants in these meetings is impressive and nearly 40% of the total are women:\n• Number of farmers and EA in training workshop from 7 countries: 9,096.\n• Number of farmers participating in Farmer Field Days: 7,859\n• PPT meeting:1,399\n• Tuta absoluta meeting: 1,188\n3. IPM IL has established collaborative linkage with a number of NGOs, Mission value chains, private contractors and to a certain extent invited the private sector in Asia and Africa to participate to achieve their objectives.\n4. The program has remarkable accomplishments in terms of long-term and short-term training. A total of 88 men (48) and women (40) were enrolled for M.S. or Ph.D. training. Around 14,492 people received short-term training.\n5. Impact analysis of IPM for six vegetables in Bangladesh showed a net present value (NPV) of $768,625 and an IRR for eggplant 42%, for tomato, 39%, and for cucumber 30%.\n6. The two modeling projects have a number of graduate students who are expected to complete their studies and degree by the end of the project. These two projects have an impact on policy by Governments to take timely action to institute pest management to avert disaster.\n7. The use of plastic sleeves, plastic mesh bags, or wax paper bags to protect the exportable fruit crops has been well received by fruit growers in Vietnam. It is labor-intensive, and bagging fruits in crops like mango, longan, and lychee are cumbersome due to height.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. A review of progress once a year through semi-annual and annual reports can be more critical and stringent but constructive and helpful.\n2. Taking steps to ensure timely funding.\n3. IPM IL should continue to serve as a catalyst to encourage and facilitate bio-pesticide business development with lead farmers, NGOs and private entrepreneurs as it has done with Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Niger to ensure sustainability.\n4. The IPM IL should encourage and provide training to rear the biocontrol agents using locally available materials so that sustainability is ensured. IPM IL should also conduct further research to examine the diversity in biocontrol agents since Zygogramma bicolorata is suitable for high rainfall areas and Listronotus setosipennis to harsh drought-stricken areas, but Parthenium is adapted to both situations.\n5. IPM IL should pay attention to the marketing problem for improved rice varieties that they are promoting. We also suggest the team conducts a socio-economic analysis of the situation to determine the adoption potential for the improved varieties before proceeding further.\n6. Exciting technology identification as has been done in Niger, Ethiopia, Kenya and Tanzania for invasive FAW control should be encouraged and promoted with other NARS.\n7. IPM IL ME and collaborators should make efforts to track how many IPM trainings are held by partner organizations that they have trained and also how many technologies have been sold by private-sector partners.\n8. More people from Africa should be given the opportunity to earn advanced degrees using IPM IL funding.\n9. ME continues to allocate sufficient funds to undertake systematic impact assessment studies in all instances where an IPM technology has been evaluated and demonstrated to be successful with the farmers.\n10. The gender specialist should work on bringing awareness of gender to the team members.\n11. The following projects in the IPM IL’s portfolio deserve serious consideration for further continued funding: i) IPM of exportable fruit crops in Vietnam, ii) IPM for vegetable and mango pests in Asia, iii) rice, maize and chickpea IPM in East Africa, and iv) biocontrol of invasive weed, Parthenium in East Africa, vi) modeling project of Biocomplexity institute, vii) climate change and biodiversity project. Continued emphasis should be placed on current and potential invasive pests in the next phase.",

      "Document Title": "LASER-PULSE: Assessment of the Research Context and Research Capacity in Higher Education Institutions in Africa",
      "Key Findings": "Makerere University, a LASER consortium member, led a capacity assessment to identify barriers to research and its translation in Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) in selected universities in sub-Saharan Africa, with the goal of identifying priority gaps for capacity building. \nA total of 27 universities (75% of targeted institutions) from 12 African countries participated. \n1. The research capacity area in which universities scored highly was ‘national research engagement’ (mean score=3.7/5). Scored moderately were in research areas: (a) research strategies and policies (mean score=3.3/5), (b) institutional support services and infrastructure (mean score=3.1/5), (c) supporting funding applications (3.4/5), (d) human resource management for research, (e) human resource development for research (3.3/5), promotion of research visibility (3.3/5), and (f) linkages, partnerships, and collaboration (3.1/5).\n\n2. Regarding ‘research policies and guidelines’, HEIs scored highly on availability of a research policy and guidelines (85.2% scoring ‘good-very good’; mean score 4.5) and on research-outputs-based promotion (mean score=4.2). They scored weakly on availability of policies for commercialization of research (48.1% scoring ‘weak-to-very weak’; mean score of 2.5), on incentivizing research (37% of universities scored ‘weak-to very weak’; mean score=2.9), and on availability of clear policies to protect intellectual property (mean score=2.9).\n\n3. Under ‘institutional support services and infrastructure’, the sub-dimensions of strength were the presence of research coordination offices at the top management level (for which 81.4% of universities scored ‘good to very good’; mean score=4.1), and presence of grants management unit (51% of universities scored ‘good-to-very good’; mean score=3.0). Areas of weakness included adequacy of research labs (mean score=2.4), data management policies and infrastructure (mean score=2.7), and adequacy of capacity for ethical and scientific review of research (mean score=2.8).\n\n4. Under ‘human resource management and development for research’, low scoring: administrative research support staff and availability of a predictable and sustainable remuneration structure for non-academic technical research staff. On ‘human resource development for research’, universities scored highest on availability of field attachments and field training for students (mean score=4.5), and lowest on availability of post-doctoral training programs. The development areas with the largest capacity gaps both in terms of the distribution of expertise and numbers of available experts were: 1) working in crises and conflict, (2) energy, 3) gender, (4) democracy and governance, and 5) water and sanitation.\n\n5. Regarding ‘promotion of research visibility’, the sub-dimension with the lowest score was ‘whether the research section of the institution’s website was up-to-date with on-going research, feed-back and knowledge products’ (48.1% of the HEIs had a ‘weak-to-none’ score; mean score=2.4) consistent with the observation that ‘research project management and control’ was one of the major capacity gap areas for universities.\n\n6. Research capacity areas in which universities scored lowest were (a) research project management and control (mean score=2.7/5), (b) continuity and sustainability (mean score=2.8/5), (c) empowerment (2.9/5), and (d) leadership (2.6/5), and (e) dissemination, knowledge translation, and research applicability (2.6/5). Factors that contributed most to the low score in the dimension of research project management and control were: the lack of information management systems to track research projects and the lack of project management training to staff.\n\n7. The dimension ‘continuity and sustainability’ scored low in the areas of inadequate funding for research support offices by universities (40.7% of HEIs returned a ‘weak or very weak score’, mean score=2.7), and availability of internal funding for research (48.1% of HEIs returned a ‘none-weak’ score, mean score=2.6). Seventy-one percent of funding for research in study HEIs comes from donors. Governments provide only 9.7% of funding. Seven and a half percent of funding comes from local institutional funds within HEIs and 7.9% from consultancies.\n\n8. Under empowerment, low-scoring sub-components included support to junior faculty and empowerment for female researchers. Two-thirds (66.7%) of HEIs scored ‘weak-to-none’ regarding the availability of incentives for female researchers while one-in-six institutions (18.5%) had no incentives at all. Only 19.8% of research projects were headed by female researchers. Only 48.2% of HEIs had an academic unit responsible for women and gender studies. Only two universities (7.4%) have over 50% female graduate enrollment. Sixty-three percent of HEIs have a PhD female enrollment of less than 30%. One-in-two universities (48.2%) have a percentage of female faculty that is less than 30%. Seventy percent of universities have a PhD-level staff of less than 30% female. \n\n9. The lowest scoring area under the leadership dimension was the availability of training courses that target cross-cutting non-technical skills important for the management of research projects including research leadership, internal communication, and research project management.\n\n10. Regarding dissemination, knowledge translation, and research applicability, all the key areas of assessment scored low: availability of translation expertise (mean score=1.9), credibility with the private sector (mean score=2.4), availability of translation support units (mean score=2.5), and translation linkages with government sectors (mean score=2.4). In general, only 20.2% of research outputs on average, from faculty and student researchers, were translated into knowledge products other than journal articles and disseminated to stakeholders over a reference period of three years. \n\n11. Regarding research portfolios, the publication output of HEIs was moderate; 29.6% of HEIs had at least 200 peer-reviewed publications while close to one-half (48.1%) had 50 or more publications. The total publication output from all 27 institutions was 6,390, with a range of 0 publications to 2,154. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "There were five areas in which HEIs scored the lowest:\n1) Research leadership and research project management\n2) Research dissemination, knowledge translation, and research applicability\n3) Empowerment, especially of female researchers and junior faculty\n4) Continuity and sustainability of research, especially research funding\n5) Institutional support services for research at the lower academic unit level\n\nIn line with these findings, the following programmatic recommendations were made:\n1. HEIs in Africa and the Sector Ministries under which they are aligned should aim to increase the capacity for research leadership. At the sector level, this requires increased funding for research activities in universities. At the HEI level, increased research capacity should be attained through the institutionalization of training courses on research leadership and research project management and making them accessible to all researchers. \n2. To make universities more relevant to the national development priorities, universities should strengthen their linkages to government sectors when creating their research agendas. \n3. The continuity and sustainability of research should become a priority for African HEIs. Governments in the region should increase their investments in research by providing dedicated funding to research and innovation projects in universities, especially those that align with national development goals. \n4. HEIs and pertinent government sectors in Africa should improve the provision of institutional support services for research at their constituent academic units. This should include re-enforcing the research support infrastructure at the operating units (including research support and grants management offices, labs, libraries and information resources, IRBs, research communication support, internet, computers and software, and research skills training.\n5. HEIs in Africa should enhance their capacity for research dissemination, knowledge translation, and promotion of research applicability. This should in part involve a) the establishment of fully-fledged knowledge translation units that support researchers to develop knowledge products for different audiences and to disseminate them to relevant stakeholders for impact, b) inclusion in the establishment of an adequate number of knowledge translation experts to support researchers in developing communication and knowledge products, c) mainstreaming knowledge translation into all research training, d) establishing strong research dissemination and use partnerships with government and implementing partners, e) establishing strong linkages with the private sector for the uptake of research products that are of interest to them.\n6. HEIs in Africa should prioritize the empowerment of groups that are marginalized within their institutional research set-up. This should mainly include empowerment of female researchers, empowerment of young and upcoming researchers, and empowerment of academic units with low research outputs and impact.\n7. Development agencies should increasingly engage African HEIs as partners in development. Being that African HEIs have the advantage of proximity to communities, development agencies and practitioners should engage them in research to provide more contextualized evidence of the development area, local implementation challenges and success factors, and intervention effectiveness.",

      "Key Findings": "The evaluation team evaluated the project on the basis of five questions. These questions explored how the project had succeeded in addressing the primary objectives of FISH, which were to increase resilience to climate change and to improve biodiversity conservation through effective sustainable fisheries co-management. Here are the short findings:\n1. The project had contributed to increasing capacity building in local communities utilizing the available information on the status of the fish stocks and fisheries. The project revamped and/or created, and trained and capacitated Beach Village Committee (BVCs), sub-Fisheries Associations (subFAs), and Fisheries Associations (FAs). However, the evaluation team found that the Fisheries Science and Technology Advisory Panel (FSTAP) was failed to fulfill its role as a contributor to the theory of change (TOC) condition of “shared, evidence-based objectives and learning”.\n\n2. A strong political will was present to support Participatory Fisheries Management (PFM) among BVCs, local governments in all four target districts, and in the Department of Fisheries (DoF). All recognized the need to support Participatory Fisheries Management (PFM) to improve fishery management in Malawi. The effectiveness of participatory fisheries management (PFM) promoted through the project is inversely correlated with human population pressures. Where the lakeshore populations are high and severe overfishing is occurring, PFM is ineffective, but in relatively less populated areas the community management committees. Longer-term BVC sustainability remains uncertain, however, without FISH support.\n\n3. The FISH project provided a great deal of support for DoF through the development of teaching curricula at MFTC, training workshops, and support for two postgraduate degrees. Fish also engaged in planning and participation in research programs aimed at developing fishery management plans and assessing impacts of initiatives such as the establishment of fish sanctuaries and brush parks.\n\n4. The project’s partnership approach to PFM was successful. The different partners all brought their particular areas of expertise to the program, and in turn, the training provided to the partners in fisheries issues developed their capacity to engage in broad-reaching natural resource participatory management.  FISH and its partners generated awareness at all levels of stakeholder engagement from beaches to Parliament, also including the private sector, such as commercial fishermen. However, this project’s stakeholder engagement was just an early stage in a long process to fully implement PFM. \n\n5. Though the potential threats posed by global climate change to the fisheries of Lakes Chilwa and Chiuta were widely recognized, they were dwarfed by the local impacts of deforestation, flash flooding, siltation, and pollution as a result of anthropogenic impacts. The rapidly burgeoning human population is putting severe stress on the aquatic ecosystems. Village committees (BVCs, RVCs, VNRMCs) were active in attempting to stem and reverse the environmental devastation.",

The research culture has been strengthened through many applied and joint research projects and successful interactions with industry, government agencies, and international colleagues.\n4. Faculty and staff have been exposed to leadership training, fundraising, and proposal-writing skills that can be transformative as the centers become self-supporting.",
      "Key Recommendations": "GOVERNANCE/LEADERSHIP\n1. Select and appoint project directors that have the required skills and experience to fully execute the project agreement. Seek comprehensive feedback and input on terms of reference from other projects and USAID staff.\n2. Create a unified cooperative agreement for all partners that can be reviewed jointly with USAID at or before the project kickoff.\n3. Security concerns should be taken into consideration while designing the project, selecting implementation partners, and developing work plans.\n4. The development of the strategic plan and road map, as well as leadership planning and training, should be conducted within the first few months of the project’s start.\n5. New centers should be integrated with other schools at their host university to leverage existing resources and strengths and ensure buy-in and sustainability.\nCURRICULUM\n1. Conduct a comprehensive survey and assessment of workforce needs before or at the start of the project.\n2. At the agreement stage, ensure that any gender equality plan is realistic and reflects a reasonable stretch goal to improve existing participation over time with milestones, regular review, and course corrections.\n3. To launch degree programs quickly, leverage existing curriculum as a basis for new programs.\n4. Create mandatory pedagogy training in the first year of the project with yearly reviews and additional training opportunities throughout the project.\n5. Create labs that serve a dual purpose: teaching and research. Partners should create lab utilization plans before procuring equipment so that labs can efficiently support both curriculum and research.\nRESEARCH\n1. Set expectations for research publications and presentations and quantify with metrics; review metrics regularly.\nProvide professional development opportunities for faculty on writing grant proposals and journal articles.\n2. Facilitate and support research presentations at academic and industry conferences.\n3. Host local research expos to showcase research done by faculty and students.\n4. Host workshops in-country. Work with partner institutions to ensure a near 100 percent participation rate by faculty and students.\n5. Create an efficient procurement process that empowers faculty.\n6. Create research evaluation forums that include relevant technical experts and create a communication mechanism that ensures continuity, and that brings new reviewers up to speed as needed.\nEXCHANGE\n1. The ASU exchange program was a transformational experience based on the feedback received from participating faculty, and students. A U.S. exchange program should be considered as a part of every donor-funded project in the area of higher education.\n2. Create an inclusion plan for women and economically disadvantaged students that factors current local participation rates and identifies incremental improvements that address cultural and economic barriers and enhance academic preparation in secondary schools.\nSUSTAINABILITY\n1. At the project start, create an action plan for strategic development, fundraising, and industry interaction that includes milestones and deliverables. Update the plan at least annually.\n2. Make sustainability a cross-cutting component or, more specifically, a mindset rather than a separate goal. In the USPCAS-E project, each component had sustainability goals. Creating a sustainability mindset ensures that all component-specific efforts align with the overall strategic direction of the centers.\n3. Identify key stakeholders and engage them regularly throughout the project. Create a stakeholders forum that meets biannually or quarterly.\n4. Create something like the National Energy Research Agenda at the beginning of the project as part of the strategic planning process.",

      "Document Title": "Higher Education Scholarship Assessment: Final report",
      "Key Findings": "Based on addressing the following four areas, the findings of the report are:\n\n1. The Main Scholarship Providers: \nNational government institutions provide most graduate scholarships in Indonesia. The Indonesia Endowment for Education (Lembaga Penjamin Dana Pendidikan, or LPDP) has by far the largest budget and supports more scholarships than do other providers. Provincial governments also have substantial funding to support overseas studies but are smaller than national providers; only one of them included the United States as a study destination. Private providers generally lack overseas study options.\n\n2. Driving Factors: \nMultiple factors drive most scholarship providers, with the most common being human resource development. Government mandates are also an important driver among government institutions. Other salient driving factors, including support of provincial high achievers and disaster response, are present but more often a concern of provincial governments and private providers’ agendas than a national concern.\n\n3. Needs for Assistance:\nScholarship providers identified a variety of technical assistance needs that would benefit their programs. The most mentioned was building collaboration with international partners, focused on developing relationships with U.S. universities, and developing a better understanding of the U.S. university system to enable better application and placement decisions. Numerous funds also mentioned the need for co-funding with international governments and universities, indicating the scholarship providers’ concern for stretching their budgets to increase the number of overseas scholarships they can fund. Each scholarship provider has specific needs in scholarship management, which could not be generalized across funds.\n\n4. Monitoring and Evaluation:\nExisting M&E systems are underdeveloped and not suitable to measure the variety of anticipated scholarship impacts. Conversely, anticipated scholarship impacts are poorly defined and difficult to measure. Most provincial and private scholarship providers have a poor conceptualization of M&E and how to build and effectively use such systems.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Main Providers:\nUSAID could focus on providing technical assistance to the national scholarship providers as they have the funding and resources to work on improving their scholarship management. Provincial governments identified as main providers in this assessment also have funding to enable overseas studies. Private providers may not be the best option for support as they focus on domestic partial undergraduate scholarships.\n\n2. Driving Factors: \nUSAID could consider two factors in working with the targeted providers:\ni. Factors driving the provision of scholarships: It is logical to focus on assisting scholarship providers that are driven by the more permanent agenda of developing human resources. However, other factors, such as government mandates, also influence this driver. In this case, as exemplified by provincial providers, the longevity of the scholarship programs might be uncertain; it may depend on the agenda of the ruling government and thus can change with election cycles. Support for politically driven scholarship funds may be warranted, but USAID would have to readjust technical assistance as agendas and programs change.\nii. Organizational nature of the targeted scholarship providers: Some provincial providers were established specifically for administering scholarships and might be temporary agencies. Risk mitigation is always necessary for designing technical assistance programs, but special attention is warranted when working with ad hoc provincial scholarship agencies.\n\n3. Nees for Assistance: \nUSAID could consider providing the following technical assistance:\ni. Help facilitates special agreements between scholarship providers and U.S. universities. \nii. Create a hub for learning and disseminating best practices in scholarship management between both the Indonesian scholarship providers and international organizations and universities.\niii. Create a marketplace forum where scholarship providers and other co-funding collaborators meet physically or virtually.\niv. Increase interest in studying in the U.S. by addressing problems in Indonesian scholarship candidates’ reluctance to sit for graduate admissions tests such as the GMAT and GRE. USAID can work with other U.S.-sponsored agencies such as EducationUSA and the American Indonesian Exchange Foundation (AMINEF) to educate the public about the American graduate education system and the strategies to succeed in standardized academic and admissions tests.\nv. Share best practices in scholarship management based on lessons learned from the Prestasi Scholarship Program.\n\n4. Monitoring and Evaluation:\nAssistance in this area could begin with an assessment of M&E knowledge among the targeted providers. For scholarship providers with clear M&E planning and objectives, USAID can help formulate realistic impact objectives, design systems to measure the objectives, and train the staff in M&E. Providers without an M&E system, or those that have a poor understanding of M&E needs related to measuring scholarship impact, will require help building basic capacity, including systems.",

      "Document Title": "Long-term Assistance and Services for Research - Partners for University-Led Solutions Engine (LASER PULSE): Understanding Vietnam’s Higher Education Institution Research Infrastructure, Research Translation, and Sustainability Mechanisms - Research Assessment Report",
      "Key Findings": "1. Research: \nThere are strong research centers and research consultancy firms particularly in Hanoi that focus on applied research including air pollution, climate change, innovation, and water resources conservation. These centers include the Air Pollution and Climate Change Research Center, the Green Innovation and Development Centre, and the Center for Water Resources Conservation and Development, and the Centre for Sustainable Development of Water Resources and Climate Change Adaptation. Some Non-Government Organizations (NGOs) and other practitioners have in-house research teams and receive competitive external funding. There was a reported need to further strengthen the quality of research done by Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). Regarding gender considerations in higher education, the Vietnamese government encourages female participation in public/technical service in general. There is a high level of female faculty participation in research: female academic staffing levels range between 40% and 70%.\n\n2. Research translation: \nBoth central and local governments are involved in the identification of research issues, the dissemination of research findings, and the implementation of the recommendations from the research findings. HEI and other researchers submit reports with recommendations to the government, but they leave it up to the government to implement the recommendations. There is no follow-up mechanism to ascertain if recommendations were implemented. There is minimal involvement from NGOs, development partners, and the private sector in the translation (application or uptake) of research. Donor-supported research partnerships are chiefly funded through Asian development agencies, with Japan serving as the main funding agency for research/translation in Vietnam. Other agencies that support research translation include USAID, and some European Union donors. There are more incentives to publish, compared with applying research findings to recommendations for policy or practice. Some peer-reviewed publications attract up to $1,000 USD per paper paid as a bonus that faculty receive for publishing.\nResearchers are hesitant to interact with media out of concern that their findings will be misrepresented or unwelcomed by the government. Some researchers mentioned that they have a hard time summarizing their findings into concise pieces that are accessible to the general population. \n\n3. Collaborations between practitioners and academics: \nThere are no guidelines on collaboration between practitioners and HEIs. Nonetheless, some practitioner organizations collaborate regularly with Vietnamese researchers. Practitioner organizations tend to contract individual academics as consultants, instead of through contracts with universities because of perceived bureaucracy, and issues of government control over public HEIs.\n\n4. Continuity and sustainability of research: \nThe Vietnamese government is the biggest funder of research for public universities. Within some universities, like the Hanoi University of Science and Technology, for-profit companies are registered to facilitate the generation of resources for the universities. These companies manage the intellectual property, estates including housing and property management, students, and university services provided to external clients, including consultancies. Most universities visited are members of Asian Universities Network where universities share opportunities including capacity building, financial support, and student exchange programs.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. For effective implementation of research recommendations, researchers should actively participate and follow up on the recommendations they have developed in the course of their research. Given the researcher’s role in generating these recommendations, it is critical they work with the government to ensure proper interpretation and implementation.\n2. Networking, especially among women leaders and women faculty, should be implemented by institutions in Vietnam as part of mentorship, role modeling, and capacity-building. Presence of female role models within HEIs and the general community should be used to catlyze the agency of women and girls to pursue an advanced career, including research-oriented positions. These female role models should serve as champions to challenge some of the social and cultural norms that hinder full female participation in research.\n3. Incentives to engage in research translation by academic faculty should be expanded to include partnerships, collaboration, program and policy influence.\n4. The current research translation is more inclined to working with government, but Vietnamese researchers should widen this scope by working with other practitioners like local and international NGOs, development partners, and the private sector. Researchers need to actively involve themselves in the work of development practitioners by working with them during the development and through the implementation of their strategies.",

      "Key Findings": "The findings of this evaluation report  are laid out in the following several parts : \n1. Origins and formative years of SEADAG:\nThe President of The Asia Society serves as Chairman of SEADAG and\ncarries legal and executive responsibility for implementation of the AID- Asia Society contractual agreement. The day-to-day administration of SEADAG is the responsibility of the Executive Secretary.\n2. SEADAG as a forum:\nTo meet its obligation to serve as an intellectual frontier, SEADAG has concentrated its efforts in a series of panels/seminars. The panel/seminars fall into three categories: country-focused seminars, panel/seminar (organized around a broad area of subject matter, Development Administration or Education and Human Resource Development), the panel/seminars (problem-oriented and relatively closely focused)\n3. The research program: \nThe research grants program has suffered a rapid decline both in dollar\namount and as a share of total SEADAG funding. As a result, academic interest in the program has sagged, applications for grants have declined in number, and expectations generated by the program have become more realistic.\n4 . SEADAG, The Asia Society, AID and academia:\nOfficials of The Asia Society, AID administrators, and individual\nscholars and aid practitioners, American and Asian, come together in SEADAG to participate in an intellectual exchange that promises a return of value to each individual. At another level, The Asia Society through SEADAG is serving as a bridge between the academic world and AID and the \"image\" held by academia of SEADAG becomes a measure of the return to the principals from their collaboration.\n\n5. SEADAG and other development institutions:\nAlthough some operating organizations recognize the work of SEADAG and benefit from it, there are significant gaps in knowledge of SEADAG and its work on the part of responsible individuals who could benefit from such knowledge. Also, a range of organizations should be receiving SEADAG publications and research results, but do not. \n\n6.  SEADAG and AID: Communication and cooperation:\nThe pace at which SEADAG has evolved to its present role reflects the mutual confidence of AID and The Asia Society officials, as well as pressures internal to the SEADAG membership and within the academic community more widely, which helped to ensure the steady transfer of\ncontrol over. SEADAG to The Asia Society.SEADAG is one among several instruments for organizing the intellectual exchange, involving AID staff, academic scholars, and officials from less developed countries. Workshops supported by AID funds are organized by the Agricultural Development Council on agricultural policy, the National Science Foundation on population policy, and the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Engineering on science and technology issues. \n\n7. The SEADAG Secretariat: The effectiveness of the SEADAG Secretariat has improved substantially over recent years. the contribution being made by the Executive Secretary in broadening the participation base of SEADAG and in introducing new exciting developmental issues to which the panel/seminars are turning. The energy and good judgment evident in the recruitment of panel/chairmen have contributed materially to the effectiveness of SEADAG as a forum.",

The donors collaborating in the Consultative Group have made a noteworthy advance in practical international cooperation.\n3. Opportunities might well be examined for extension of this precedent to other areas of research and technical assistance.\n4. Most of the apparent avenues for operational interrelationship have been pursued with substantial effectiveness in the maize network if the segment examined for this study is indicative.\n5. The organizational and technological means are available to assist developing countries to accomplish major increases in maize production, with improved food value.\n6. Much of the earlier international cooperation in maize research and much of the strength of the current structure has resulted from the collaborative impulse of researchers functioning through the informal international scientific fraternity.\n7. Financial sponsors and administrators should recognize the contribution of this \"old boy network\" and facilitate its extension and operation. \n8. A.I.D., in particular, has achieved a high degree of coordination among activities that it finances or can influence.\n9. Continuing efforts should be made by those involved to further refine and extend the agricultural research and technical assistance networks, building on the comprehensive system already functioning, with A.I.D. having a major opportunity and responsibility because of its widespread presence overseas and the potential impact of its financing, its facilities, and its encouragement.\n",

Loan Amount: $7, 600, 000\n\n3. Terms: Repayment in 40 years, including 10-year grace; 2% during\nthe grace period and 3% thereafter.\n\n4. Purpose: To upgrade and expand Pakistan's agricultural research\ncapability, both national and provincial, to effectively deal with problems in priority commodity/crop areas so as to increase agricultural production for domestic consumption and exports.\n\n5. Project Description: A five-year program to develop and upgrade\nPakistan's agricultural research institutes and colleges and to establish\nand equip a National Research Center to coordinate and carry out priority research projects. Commodities, expatriate technical advisors (including intermediaries), and academic and practical training for\nprofessionals and sub-professionals will be financed over a five-year period. An evaluation system, including workshops and an evaluation panel, will permit the assessment of research work undertaken and implementation progress.\n\n6. Total Costs: The total cost of the expanded research program is estimated at $19. 6 million, of which $9. 6 million is for foreign exchange costs and $10. 0 million for local currency costs. Of the foreign exchange costs, 30/ is for commodities, 42% for technical advisory assistance, and 28% for training.\n\n7. Other Sources of Financing: The agricultural research program has been discussed with other multilateral and bilateral donors including IBRD, FAO, UNDP, Ford, and Rockefeller Foundation. It is clear from these discussions that while other multilateral donors will continue contributing in modest way as they have been in the past, they are not in a position to make the major input required and which has been requested of AID.",

      "Key Findings": "1. The evaluation team concludes that the \"Project under the Loan agreement is, in general, soundly conceived, and is consistent with current and long-range national goals for strengthening the research capability for overall improvement in the agricultural sector.\n\n2. The program of work called for under the Loan Agreement is\nvery ambitious. It would have required a high level of performance even by a fully-staffed ARC (Agricultural Research Council) to have completed all the activities as proposed. To complicate matters, a number of unanticipated problems arose which have had the effect\nof materially delaying the implementation of planned activities. Several\nparts of the Project are about two years behind schedule. But\ncommendable actions have been accomplished in initiating four major national research schemes, in preparing for the implementation of other national schemes, and in proceeding with the acquisition of about 1500 acres of land for a national agricultural research center.\n\n3. Several unforeseen events have contributed to slow progress in\nprograms under the Loan Agreement: i. Director General position was vacated just prior to the signing of the Loan Agreement. The Deputy Director-General was made working as Director and has continued in this role. ii. lack of staffing in ARC in general, and in the administrative services side in particular. iii. Problems regarding the acquisition of land for the Agricultural Research Center.\n\n4. ARC is to be commended for moving ahead in the development of national research programs. other important measures are i) arrangements to fill the post of DG in near future ii) provisions to consolidate key staff offices in Islamabad iii) appointment of important supporting administrative staff, including a procurement officer iv. acquisition of land for PARC.",
      "Key Recommendations": "The Review Team r~ommend8 that the Agricultural Research Loan Project be continued without modification for one additional\nyear in order to permit the Agricultural Research Council to implement\nmore fully the provisions of the agreement. Continuance or modifications in the Loan Agreement after this additional year should be based on the degree to which deficiencies described in this report are corrected.\n\n1. Top priority should be given to the appointment of a Director General with the qualifications necessary to provide strong leadership both as a manager and scientist to make ARC fully effective as an operating organization.\n2. Arrangements should be completed for the appointment of a Research advisor with the necessary qualifications as a scientist and also, experience in both management and administration of a research entity.\n3. The appointment of coordinators required for research projects\nalready approved under the loan agreement program should proceed\nforthwith. \n4. Emphasis should be placed on developing effective organizational\narrangements, including clear statements of responsibility.\n5. The make-up of the ARC Executive Sub-committee is unwieldy in numbers and ineffective in action. The number of members should be reduced and a Steering Committee formed to make it more efficient and effective. \n6. Appointment of a full-time training officer in ARC.\n7. Establishment within ARC of a procurement cell headed by a procurement officer responsible to the Director of Administrative Services, or the equivalent in the ARC organization.\n8. ARC, in consultation with AID and others,  re-assess the need for expatriate technicians during the remaining period under the Project.\n9. Urgent attention should be given to the construction of staff\nhouses.",

The approach adopted\nby PCARR in bringing together selected stations with certain\ndegrees of research capability and developing them into research\ncenters appear to be the most logical and practical solution.\nUpgrading is being undertaken in terms of improving the research\nlaboratories, fields, equipment, and personnel, as well as\nmanagement procedures. The development of such technology generating centers in the rural areas is the most rational companion-program to the government development approach based on the concept of regional development all both a goal and a means to national development. As organized, the national and regional research\ncenters already operational under the leadership of PCARR are\nbeginning to take a lead role in both the formulation and execution of the research programs which are aimed at backstopping the agricultural development programs of the regions as coordinated under the guidance of the National Economic and Development Authority with which PCARR has established a close relationship.\n\nThe proposed loan project together with the first loan will place\nin position ten such research centers to play the development role\nintended for them. These represent about two-thirds of the 16\nresearch centers being developed in the PCARR station for\nthe decentralization of the research effort. With the increasing\nsupport the Philippine Government is providing PCARR in the\nmodernization of the agricultural research system, the viability\nof the project is believed assured.",

      "Document Title": "Report ofthe Review Team Philippine Council For Agriculture and Resouces Research",
      "Key Findings": "1. The USAID Loan I report is incorporated with the over-all report on\nthe Corporate Review of PCARR, although it is written so that it can be\nused alone.\n2. The report addresses the following major topics:\na) Status of Loan supported institutions\nb) Implementation and management of research programs\nc) Quality of research supported under Loan I\nd) Manpower training and management\ne) Planning for future loans\n3. The Review Team found that the buildings, irrigation and water\nsystems, staff housing, and general research farm improvements provided under Loan I were badly needed and now have a potential for greatly enhancing the research output of these centers. The major current needs for productivity in research are for supplies and operating funds.\n4. The full utilization of the loan and accelerated programming of\nLoan II are remarkable achievements for the PCARR staff and demonstrate the effective cooperation and helpful work by USAID staff.\n5. It was noted that PCARR sometimes had difficulty coordinating and\nsupervising the allocation of resources among physical infrastructure,\nequipment, and manpower development and in selection and installation of equipment.\n6. Several policy issues were raised regarding the allocation of resources within the four centers:\na) The early decision to identify and strengthen an educational\ninstitution as the lead agency has many advantages, but it did not\neffectively build on existing strengths.\nb) The investment in physical resources cannot pay dividends\nwithout strong attention to research leadership early in the program.\n7. The production of research results is very considerable at the\ncenters which had a history of research, but those that are relatively\ninexperienced in research are not yet making significant contributions.\n8. The research agenda is characterized by a catalog of some 6000\nresearch projects, but there is insufficient evidence that these add up\nto programs with the potential for significantly affecting national or regional production at an early date. Recommendations are made by the Review Team for greater direction and concentration of effort to hasten the impact on production.\n9. The quality of research activity is spotty. Some fields are highly\nproductive of research information, while others are of observational\nvalue at best. In very few places is laboratory research very active\nand even fewer are intimate adjuncts to field research.\n10. Dissemination of research results is weak. PCARR does a good job\nof summarizing and disseminating the information that comes to it, but\nit cannot compensate for inadequate analysis and reporting at the sources of information.\n11. The linkage of research results with off-station trials and with\nextension specialist preparation is weak and should be strengthened.\n12. The implementation of manpower training under the loan followed the original schedule fairly closely and is making a significant contribution to the research capability in the country.\n13. The aggressive and successful manpower training program that is\ncurrently underway will require early positive action on salary and\nother incentives if this manpower is to be kept in productive roles in\nresearch. Several recommendations are made in this respect.\n14. The Team made several observations and recommendations regarding future loans.\na) The centers that are supported under Loans I and II should be\nfurther strengthened and supported in future loans before adding new\ncenters to the support program. This is particularly important in view\nof the slow rate at which operational funding by GOP is increasing and\nthe dim prospects for greater increases by MOB.\nb) Future loans for the PCARR network should take into account plans\nnow underway by the Ministry of Agriculture to establish Coordinated\nAgricultural Research Stations in each of the 12 political regions of\nthe Philippines.\nc) Future loans should be very sensitive to the emerging regional\nthrusts in order to avoid the development of technologies for which there is no absorptive capacity in the regions.\nd) The rapidly changing economic situation in the world and in the Philippines requires changes of direction in all sectors. The responsiveness of PCARR will be critical and the intimate cooperation of USAID in adjusting loan program requirements is essential.",
      "Key Recommendations": "National Network of Research Centers and Stations\nRecommendation 1:There is confusion in the terminology between regional research centers and the 10 research consortia/ centers. The designation of the centers, consortia, and stations in the National Network should be clarified.\nRecommendation 2. Funds under future loans should be used primarily to support existing or contemplated research programs rather than building infrastructure at additional locations.\nRecommendation 3. PCARR should concentrate research in its national and regional network and should utilize the cooperating stations only when needed to evaluate locally the research conducted at the centers.\n\nResearch Program Planning and Management\nRecommendation 4. PCARR should develop strong national priority commodity programs through the mechanism of local problem identification, regional priority assessment (with NEDA and the research center leaders), and then national organization, evaluations, and recommendation for funding through the Research Divisions and TPPRB. The Research Divisions and investigation leaders would then be able to initiate, review and assign projects to implementing agencies with minimum review by the TPPRB under the general responsibility of the Director-General and the Governing Council.\nRecommendation 5: In order to set effective research priorities, insure\nthat research is done promptly in conformance with the priorities, and insure that the research is of high quality, PCARR should assess research capabilities of implementing agencies and then assign projects to those places where they can be done best.\nRecommendation 6: To carry out this assessment, PCARR should develop a set of criteria by which the research capabilities of implementing agencies can be evaluated. The criteria should be used to establish standards for research leadership, staff capability, physical facilities and equipment, and the suitability of the location.\nRecommendation 7: Regional program planning and coordination should be strengthened through the PCARR regional centers, the regional center coordinating committees, the regional center coordinator, and regional commodity committees. The Regional Executive Director of NEDA and the regional Director of MOA should be made members of the RCCC.\nRecommendation 8: The gap between research needs of the integrated\nnational and regional programs and the programming of research by PCARR to meet these needs must be bridged. PCARR should develop a specific proposal to provide a better means of coordinating research plans with the needs of the several integrated programs of national and regional development.\nRecommendation 9: Research resources should be applied to high-priority problems. Efforts should not be dissipated in numerous unrelated small projects at scattered institutions of varying capabilities.\nRecommendation 10: PCARR should develop greater flexibility in its system of program planning, establishing priorities, and budgeting and\nproject system. It should be capable of responding promptly to research problems of small farmers, producers of plantation crops, and producers of important export crops.\nRecommendation 11: PCARR should review the effect on national research capability and productivity of the establishment of special research institutes. Such review should consider the effect of such institutes on multidisciplinary research programs, on availability of trained manpower, and on availability of experienced research leaders and administrators.\nRecommendation 12: The establishment of research centers and stations should not outpace the development of capable research leaders. A station with land, buildings, equipment and even research staff will be ineffective without strong leadership and direction.\nRecommendation 13: PCARR should improve its research monitoring and evaluation system to provide information on which qualitative judgments can be made. PCARR Secretariat should consolidate reports in contrast to the current massive listings of individual project data. In developing this system PCARR needs top-rate, full-time investigation leaders.\nRecommendation 14: PCARR should continue to cooperate with, support, and seek the advice of the research programs of commodity commissions and authorities such as PCA, PHILSUCOM, AIDA, etc.\nManpower Training and Personnel Management\nRecommendation 15: PCARR should appoint a full-time qualified person for manpower training and personnel management, to provide leadership for this increasingly important component of the organization's responsibilities. The administrator and staff of this unit would be responsible for (1) the management of a manpower development program for the network and (2) developing an Agriculture and Resources Research Service to improve procedures and employment conditions for research personnel.\nRecommendation 16: Priority attention should be given to the improvement of salaries for researchers to reflect levels of education and experience. For the regional centers PCARR must take the lead in providing attractive living and working conditions for researchers.\nRecommendation 17: PCARR should encourage centers and consortia to develop reasonable, phased plans for upgrading (degree) existing personnel, developing new positions, and meeting in-service training needs. Nominations for scholarships should come from the directors of centers and consortia and be directly tied to plans for the development of their research units.\nRecommendation 18: A larger portion of Ph.D.'s should receive their\ndegree training--or at least a year of course work--at universities in\nthe U.S., Australia, New Zealand, Europe or other Asian countries, in\norder to diversify the researcher pool.\n\nFunding and Financial Procedures\nRecommendation 19: The program priority ranking and budget allocation should include consideration of regional priorities and requirements.\nRecommendation 20: In the negotiation and monitoring of foreign assisted projects, PCARR and the Government implementing agency should closely coordinate with the MOB to insure that local counterpart funds and loan proceeds are provided for in the agency's annual budget appropriation. The Government should also commit the provision of budget for maintenance and operation even after the Loan agreement period.\nRecommendation 21: The PCARR Grants-in-Aid (GIA) budget should give priority support to the strengthening of regional research centers,\nespecially Loan I-recipient stations and those researchers who have\ncompleted their advanced training and have returned to their respective research institutions. It is important that staff who have jusL returned from graduate training be given research support immediately after having completed their studies.\nRecommendation 22: PCARR should be the clearinghouse for funding all foreign assisted agriculture and resources research programs. The\nlinkage of PCARR with implementing agencies on foreign assisted project preparation, negotiation, implementation, monitoring and evaluation should involve the scientists at the working level.\nRecommendation 23: Future loans for station development should have enough provision for foreign exchange to purchase important scientific equipment that must be imported. This is necessary to make every research laboratory operational.\nRecommendation 24: PCARR should take the lead in developing priority research programs, the funding of which must be presented to MOB under separate KBI's rather than a single-lump sum amount for GIA.\nRecommendation 25: Research program budgeting and funding through research centers should be under PCARR leadership -n cooperation with the Regional Development Councils (RDCs), the regional offices of NEDA and the line agencies, and must be entered into the budget as KBIs for the regious concerned.\n\nDevelopment and Application of Useful Technology\nRecommendation 26: PCARR is urged to address its full attention to the\ndevelopment of the Agricultural Support Services Project II proposed for World Bank funding. This is particularly important with respect to the orderly process of research network development, to meet the needs of farmers and producers in the Philippines.\nRecommendation 27: It is recommended that PCARR explore the possibility of having BAEx staff assigned as subject matter specialists to research stations and centers in the network to improve the process of problem identification, the interpretation of results and the packaging of technology. Subject matter specialists might be given the same type of rewards in terms of scholarships and incentives as offered to researchers.\nRecommendation 28: The farming resources and systems research and the socio.-econoics research divisions of PCARR are encouraged to work more closely with the commodity oriented units (and vice versa) in order that research projects dealing with small farm units may be better designed and packaged.\n\nInformation Services\nRecommendation 29. PCARR should improve upon its capabilities in information management by evolving an integrated system of current modules. The system should be designed as a repository for research information that can be assembled in assessing the qualitative and quantitative aspects of research in the national research system.\n\nThe Governing and Directorate Structure\nRecommendation 30. The Governing Council should continue to have members of high levels in the Government, includlng the Minister of Agriculture, Minister of Natural Resources, and others. The meetings of the Council should be reduced from a monthly to a quarterly basis. Issues presented to the council should be consistent with its role as a policy making body concerned with effective operation and administration of PCARR, assessment of the overall research program, budget approvals, and personnel management procedures.\nRecommendation 31: The Technical Program Planning and Review Board (TPPRB) should be reduced to no more than 15 or\n16 members. The PCARR staff should continue to serve as resource\npersons and not as members of the Board.\nRecommendation 32: The TPPRB was intended to be constituted to assist the Director General of PCARR. The Board should be responsive to the Director General, its Chairman, who will in turn furnish the linkage to the Governing Council, of which he is a member. The TPPRB should serve in its intended role as a policy and procedures Board, with details of operations delegated to the Secretariat.\nRecommendation 33: The Secretariat of PCARR should be reorganized to establish line and staff functions capable of directing and managing the national research system.\nRecommendation 34: There should be an Assistant Director General-Agricultural Research, and an Assistant Director General-Natural Resources Research to furnish identity and leadership for these two responsibilities of PCARR. The research divisions for the two areas of activities would come under the respective Assistant Directors General. This would provide for greater attention to natural resource research which is currently lagging in PCARR--particularly in Mines research.\nRecommendation 35. The Research Divisions should be headed by full-time senior scientists with experience and stature in accord with their\nnational responsibilities. The same holds true for assistant directors\nfor divisions requiring such posts.\nRecommendation 36: Full-time \"investigations leaders,\" with the training, experience and stature to give meaningful direction to the planning, execution, and evaluation of research programs should be designated in place of the team leaders now functioning in PCARR.\nRecommendation 37: Highly trained research scientists are still a\nscarce commodity in the Philippines and an unacceptably high proportion of their time is devoted to administrative detail and paperwork. There is urgent need for technical leadership and guidance in the field and laboratory from these skilled and experienced scientists and PCARR needs to find mechanisms for this kind of impact on research production.\nRecommendation 38: An Assistant Director General for Technical Support Services should be appointed, under the Deputy Director for operations, to give leadership to (a)research station development, (b)manpower training and personnel management, (c)coordination of workshops, and (d)consolidated information and documentation services.",

The research projects are\ngrouped into four areas, Energy, Manufacturing, Public Works, and\nSocio-Economic Development. Each project is led by a principal\ninvestigator from the M.I.T. faculty, the Cairo University\nfaculty, and a representative from the interested ministry. The\nspecific accomplishments of the projects are significant. In addition to the specific results, however, a broader impact upon the development process is evident. Within the context of the projects, awareness of the value of cooperation between ministry personnel and the academic community has developed. Educational opportunities have been provided where a need was apparent and the capabilities of both the faculty and ministry participants have improved as a result.\n\nAlthough the progress of the program toward attaining the first two goals has been noteworthy, the permanency of that impact is dependent upon the achievement of the third goal the establishment of an institutional framework at Cairo University. At the present time progress has been made in arriving at that goal. The Center for Development Research and Technological Planning has been established at Cairo University. This center is an autonomous unit that has its own bylaws and is free from regular governmental financial and administrative regulations. A director and a board of directors have been appointed. An organizational structure, administrative and financial procedures have been developed. The scope of the Centers's interest is broader than that covered in the Cairo University/M.I.T. Technological Planning Program and has the capability to reach all areas related to development plans for Egypt. Additional time and experience with the Center operation will be necessary in order to fully evaluate its contribution.",

      "Key Findings": "Priority researchable ICP projects are identified for each of the three USAID funding modes, i.e. central bureau funded, regional bureau funded, and Mission funded. Africa has been identified as a priority region because of the consistent food deficits; most African countries are in desperate need of assistance in achieving stabilized crop production and increased productivity of basic food crops. For this reason much of the recommended research is oriented to the problems of African agriculture.\nLinkages and organizational modes are suggested for each type of research and development project. Briefly described is an approach to ICP research and development as well as training components that should be included in each of the recommended projects.",
      "Key Recommendations": "It is recommended that ICP research and development assistance projects, irrespective of funding mode, incorporate a strong academic training component. It is stressed that graduate research should be undertaken in the agroecological zone in which the potential scientist will be working. Academic training can be obtained in U. S. institutions and the degree candidate can return to his native country to conduct research studies under the direction of a major professor in-country or in the collaborating U. S. institution. In the latter case, the professor would be required to make periodic visits to the research site to discuss the design and implementation of the research,",

      "Document Title": "Mid-Term Evaluation of the University Linkages Project",
      "Key Findings": "1. With this project's inception in 1980, a new organization, the Foreign Relations Coordination Unit (FRCU), was established under the Supreme Council of Universities. It served as the coordinator of all CIP procurements for the eleven public universities as well as worked as a granting agency, reviewing, approving/disapproving, and funding applied research in Egyptian universities.\n2. Since the fall of 1981, the FRCU has been working to establish and put into motion a research granting mechanism. Of the $ 29.8 million in total project grant funds, $ 24.5 million is to be contributed by AID and $5million is to be contributed by the GOE; of the $ 4 million of support costs (technical assistance, training, FRCU/Committee support, evaluation, etc.), $ 3 million is to come from AID and $ 1 million from the GOE.\n3. Up to this point, all proposals and processes are concerned only with the \"minilinkages\" i.e., the very specific, focused research activities, now preparing to begin consideration and funding of the \"maxilinkages\" -- the larger, interdisciplinary, more broadly developmental research efforts included in the project's design. \n4. The capacity-building proposals are reviewed less rigorously by the priority committees. The evaluation team is concerned with the FRCU's interpretation of the capacity building. In fact, they would consider this the least impressive activity and most troublesome aspect of the ULP.\n5. As specified in the project, the technical assistance contract was signed with Arthur D. Little International (ADLl) a year after the\nFRCU had been established and begun work on the ULP. ADLI entered\nthe ULP picture with the FRCU already staffed and progressing on the\nproject's objectives. The evaluation team has considerable doubts about the effectiveness of Arthur D Little in its assigned role and about the soundness of that role as well.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "1) The FRCU should be staffed to a greater extent than present by\nindividuals who can devote their attention and loyalties more fully to\nthe FRCU and its development. These individuals should be willing to accept responsibility and take risks.\n2) A senior-level FRCU staff member should sit with each priority\ncommittee (perhaps 3 committees per staff member) in order to standardize procedures and disseminate innovations more widely.\n3) Measures must be taken to activate all priority committees and\nstimulate acceptable proposals in all priority areas.\n4) The FRCU should continue to improve its communications with\nproposers and should not hesitate to notify a proposer of the rejection\nof his proposal.\n5) The FRCU should establish specific deadlines (perhaps every three or\nfour months) for the submission and consideration of proposals.\n6) Tenure on the priority committees (currently unlimited) should be\ngiven a specific time limit (e.g., two years), and membership should be\nrotated over time so that more individuals who possess certain expertise in their fields have the opportunity to serve on committees.\n7) The first and third quarterly reports required on all research\nshould be very brief (perhaps 5 pages) and should be commented on to the researchers within one week of submission.\n8) The FRCU should request funding at least a quarter in advance of its\nneeds to allow AID sufficient processing time. In addition, AlD should\nalways be in search of ways to minimize its own bureaucracy and\nconsequent delays in processing.\n9) The FRCU should reconsider its definition of capacity building and\nthe presentation of this concept to the universities. Clear and specific\nguidelines should be formulated (and explained to all universities) that\nfocus capacity building on improving the institutional abilities of a\nuniversity to participate in development work in the future.\n10) Efforts should be made to assist professors in a better proposal\npreparation.\n11) AID should not assume that technical assistance always will be needed to assist host country organizations.\n12) ADLI should be reduced to its one Data and Information Advisor, and the other current personnel on the ADLI team should not be extended.\n13) AID should revise the ULP's timetable (retrospectively, if\nnecessa:-y) to reflect more realistic expectations of how swiftly\n\"Institutionalization\" can occur. In addition, AID should continue to be\nprepared for even more delays since institutionalization always may take longer than anticipated.\n14) Several of the top management in the FRQJ should visit the major U.S. granting organizations (e.g., the National Science Foundation, the\nFulbright Commission) for stimulation of ideas and alternatives in\nstructuring and running the FRCU.\n15) In future project designs, AID should reconsider the need for and/or the specified role of technical assistance middlemen.\n",

      "Key Findings": "In terms of effectiveness current Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) has severe weakness of affecting production at the farm level. Research often is done without the knowledge of farm problems and needs, extension activities are confined primarily to the introduction of new varieties because other technology does not exist or is not farm tested and the availability of quality inputs is uncertain or unavailable in the hills. Long-term institutional development and reorganization are necessary to address these problems. The project as designed addresses these constraints.\n\nThe ICP program, to be terminated in May 1985, has successfully demonstrated the utility of CSR/E methodology. Specifically, it is possible to comprehend and minimize or eliminate small farm production constraints by conducting research and extension programs directly on small farms in close collaboration with the farmers.\n\nThe ARP program will build upon the success of ICP. CSR/E will be expanded into a full-scale FSR/E thrust by including livestock, socioeconomics, horticulture, agroforestry, and minor crops as well as the major grain crops. FSR/E will concentrate on the hill farmers and will continue CSR activities in the Terai.\n\nCSR/E has profited immeasurably from close association with the lARCs. But, by and large, the lARC inputs have been related to crop variety improvement - breeding lines and variety testing. While the number of improved varieties has expanded, research and extension on other factors (soil fertility and plant nutrition; on-farm water management, and insect, disease, and weed control) of crop productivity have not kept pace.",

      "Document Title": "Report of the External Evaluation of Agricultural Research Development Project II",
      "Key Findings": "In the 11 short years of its existence, PCARRD has made significant progress in achieving its objectives. In addition to improving the planning and management of research, it has provided leadership in strengthening the capability of the Philippines to implement research. \n\nThe Review Team feels that PCAARD has utilized Project II funds effectively to achieve the goals of improving the research capability in the Philippines: \n\n1. Agricultural Research Development Projects I and II provided the equivalent of $20.0 million in new infrastructure. As of December 31, 1983, with six months remaining in the project, 58% of the total infrastructure in Project II was completed, 30% ongoing, and only 12% to be implemented or in the bidding/designing/awarding stage.\n2. Since 1976, equipment and library materials worth $4.4 million have been added to agricultural research centers/stations to the PCARRD Secretariat. As of December 31, 1983, 84% of equipment project II\nhad been procured.\n3. Since 1973, when PCARRD started its manpower development program, PCARRD has awarded a total of 820 grants for Philippine degree training -75 B.S., 645 M.S., and 100 Ph.D./DBA. Two-thirds of these were awarded to institutions outside the Manila/Los Banos area. Fifty-six percent of the recipients have graduated and 20 percent are continuing; only 12 percent terminated due to failure to meet standards. International training grants were awarded to 195 researchers and support staff 9 Ph.D. 113 non-degree short-term training, and 73 travel grants for participation in scientific conferences, meetings, and study tours.\n4. The percent of PCARRD-funded research projects outside the Manila/Los Banos area under Project II increased from 23 percent in 1981 to 32 percent in1982 and to 50 percent in1983. And the corresponding 4mount of funds for these projects went from 11 percent in1981 to 41 percent in1982 and 40 percent in1983.",
      "Key Recommendations": "The Review Team recommends that PCARRD should:\n1. Assist the regional consortia/centers make a critical review of national, regional, and cooperating station commodity assignments to better match current needs/ goals with research and development capabilities.\n2. Continue to assist in strengthening key national and regional research centers and focus particular attention on improving the centers' capacity to maintain meaningful regional institutional cooperation through consortia and programs.\n3. Assist the different consortia/centers improve research leadership and management capabilities.\n4. Continue to explore, refine and expand technology dissemination\nwithin the comprehensive framework, which has been so innovatively developed.\n5. Take immediate steps to complete construction and procurement of equipment for all research facilities at its regional research centers, to assist the regional research centers in securing GOP support for their proper maintenance and use, and request USAID to extend Research Loan 11 to December 31, 1984.\n6. Review and clarify its system of research priorities, program thrusts, and major research thrusts with the objective of developing a simpler, more obvious allocation system, clearly corresponding to national development objectives and taking into consideration regional needs and potentials.\n7. Take steps to significantly increase its total GIA budget, particularly the regular GIA components from the Philippine government. This is consistent with national policy as embodied in the NEDA Five Year\nDevelopment Plan, to increase R & D investment from 0.45% of GDP in 1981 to 2%of GDP by 1987.\n8. Take the lead in organizing comprehensive national commodity research and development programs, beginning with two or three key commodities which might give relatively quick results.\n9.

      "Document Title": "Agricultural Research and Technology Transfer by the Private Sector in India",
      "Key Findings": "1. Private-sector research is growing in India. At least US$18 million were invested in agricultural research by the private sector in 1985. This is about 7 percent of the total agricultural research in India. While most of the private sector research is very applied, some Indian companies are conducting more basic research in the areas of plant biotechnology, agricultural engineering, and poultry breeding\n2. Private research has had an impact on agricultural productivity, but further studies will be required to accurately measure its impact. Private plant breeding has led to private pearl millet hybrids which may cover almost 2 million ha., sorghum hybrids on 200,000 ha., and maize hybrids on 300,003 ha. New breeds of poultry are beginning to have an impact. Feeds research has improved commercial poultry productivity and cut the cost of feed. Pesticide research has increased the spread and productivity of the pesticides used in India.\n3. There is evidence that both the amount and direction of private research have been influenced by government policy. Some companies interviewed suggested that government policy has discouraged local agricultural research. The policy has affected the direction of research. Indian chemical research concentrates on process innovation rather than product innovation. Private seed research is concentrated almost exclusively on hybrid crops because there are no property rights on other crops.\n4. There is more basic research in India than in any of the other countries surveyed. This appears to be mainly due to the scale effect -the Indian market for seeds, pesticides, poultry, and tractors is far larger than any of the other economies surveyed. \n5. AID's most important contribution to private research was providing scholarships to train scientists abroad and helping the agricultural universities. Government and university research has assisted the development of the private sector, and government and university scientists have been hired by the private sector.",
      "Key Recommendations": "AID could assist the private sector by encouraging a better understanding of the government policies that encourage or constrain private research. Conferences and research on this topic could promote policies and government agricultural research that takes advantage of the capacities of the private sector to develop new technology. AID might also be able to encourage private research through competitive research grants to the private research programs or cooperative public-private research projects. Programs like the AID-PACT program that encourages contact between private sector scientists in the U.S. and India may also be useful.",

      "Document Title": "Agricultural Research and Technology Transfer by the Private Sector in the Philiphines ",
      "Key Findings": "1. Agricultural research by the private sector is now between 32 and 40 percent of the total research conducted in the Philippines. However, it is still small compared to the value of agriculture - only 0.1% of the value of agricultural GDP. The seed industry, pesticide industry, and plantation and processing industries had the largest research programs. There was also research in livestock feeds and shrimp production but the quantity is unknown. There is a considerable amount of innovative activity in the agricultural machinery industry but most of it is informal R and D.\n2. Research by the government, IRRI, CIMMYT, and Rockefeller Foundation led to methods for controlling downy mildew in hybrid corn and methods for producing hybrid rice which led to private breeding programs in these crops. The presence of IRRI and UPLB has led four companies to establish Asian regional research programs in Los Banos. A second important activity was the training of agricultural scientists which enabled companies to use local staff rather than expatriates. Third, policies that. allowed the concentration of economic power resulted in some firms which were large enough to capture substantial benefits from research. Fourth, policies that allowed research-oriented foreign firms 100 percent ownership in local subsidiaries helped induce some companies to locate research facilities in the Philippines, Fifth, utility patents seem to have stimulated innovative activity in the agricultural machinery industry.\n3. The major impact of private technology transfer and research has been in the poultry and swine sector and the plantation sector. Poultry and swine technology was imported from outside and has been modified by formal and informal research to be more productive in Philippine conditions. Plantation research reduced the cost production of bananas and pineapples and increased yield per ha of sugarcane. Pesticides introduced by the private sector have increased the yields of rice, vegetables, and bananas. Plant breeding is beginning to have some impact with 50,000 ha under hybrid corn. Innovations in agricultural machinery have reduced the imports of foreign machinery and parts and increased the efficiency of local machinery.\n4. AID has indirectly supported the development of private research through its support for government research programs, agricultural universities, and international agricultural research centers. The current weakness of the government research and university programs suggests that an important way of strengthening private research in the future will be to invest in public sector research. Some of this support could be targeted at programs that would be particularly useful to the private sector - i.e. the development of white inbreds of corn or novelization of cane and releasing the early generations to the private sector for their cane breeding programs. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "There are at least four types of activities that would encourage more private research and technology transfer. First, AID can assist public sector research which will, in turn, induce more private sector research. Public sector research in the Philippines is now in a financial and perhaps an intellectual crisis. It requires continued assistance from AID. This will, in turn, assist private agribusiness -particularly, if government research will open up more to the needs of agribusiness. Some resources might be provided on a competitive grant basis which would be open to private and public sector research organizations.\n\nSecond, AID can assist the universities which educate the scientists\nfor both the private and public research systems. Private sector researchers were educated at Los Banos, USM, and other government universities. Many of them also did graduate work in the United States. There are signs that its human capital is not sufficient to meet the country's needs. A number of companies located regional research programs in the Philippines because of the availability of well-trained scientists and the presence of IRRI and UPLB. The Philippines no longer has the comparative advantage in scientific manpower that it once had over its neighbors. AID assisted in developing scientific manpower to its present level. AID should look for ways it can in which continue to support manpower development.\n",

Estimates for livestock and horticultural crop research programs show a significant positive CGIAR impact as well. National extension spending is also stimulated by CGIAR programs. These estimates are based on an econometric specification that takes into account the impact of several economic development aid initiatives in addition to the activities of the CGIAR impacts.\n\nCGIAR Center programs have also had significant impacts on crop productivity for maize, millets, sorghum, rice, wheat, beans, cassava, and potatoes in all the regions studied. National research programs have had a positive impact on crop productivity in most of these crops as well. In addition, national extension programs have been productive in some crops. These estimates are based on crop production data in 25 countries.",

All available evidence indicates that the long-term training element of the project has not accomplished the objectives as set forth in the project documents and will not do so in the future.\n2. After numerous delays, implementation of the management information system (MIS) element of the project appears to be progressing and approaching the point where it can become an effective management tool.\n3. The short-term training element of the project has had many delays and problems for a variety of reasons but is row functioning well and the pace of implementation is increasing rapidly. However, additional inputs of both funds and personnel will be required to meet the desired objectives of institutionalizing training capabilities in the cooperating Ministries.\n4. There have been numerous problems connected with the technical assistance inputs and implementation of the project. Most of these have been resolved, but a few points still need to be clarified.\nIf additional funds are transferred to the short-term training sector, it will be imperative that additional inputs be made to the technical assistance element.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. It is strongly recommended that all uncommitted funds available in the long-term element of the project be transferred to the short-term element where they can be utilized more effectively and that the long-term element is phased out.\n2. It is recommended that every effort be made to complete the input of data to the MIS, to train the staff of the Ministry of Education and Youth (MOEY) at all levels in inputting data, in system maintenance, and in the utilization of the MIS for improved MOEY operations.\n3. A detailed analysis should be made of the present status and operational capabilities of the short-term training element of the project in relation to desired objectives. A detailed operational plan should then be developed to guide the effective utilization of additional inputs.\n4.  A detailed analysis should be made of the technical assistance inputs, counterpart requirements, and logistical support required to effectively implement an expanded short-term training program. A detailed operational plan should then be developed and mutually agreed upon by all participating agencies.",

      "Key Findings": "1. In reference to the projected outputs, significant progress is evident in the rehabilitation of research facilities at the Farm of the Makerere University (MU)/Faculty of Agriculture and Forestry (FAF) (Kabanyolo) and at the Kawanda Research Station of the Ministry of Agriculture (MA). If rehabilitation continues as planned, both should be capable of a reasonable level of operation by the end of the present project in September 1988. Also, at both locations, farm equipment is now arriving so the operation of the farms should be possible by the end of the present phase of the project. The TA Project Staff have carried out their work very well. However, at both locations, there are few if any local funds to support any significant research. Therefore, the actual implementation of research in the short run will be highly dependent upon project and other external funds to meet most of the recurrent expenditures. There have been long delays in procurement of laboratory equipment and supplies by the USAID selected Procurement Services Agency (PSA) and from all reports by project staff and staff of the implementing agencies, the present PSA arrangement is unsatisfactory.\n2. The Rehabilitalitation of teaching facilities at MU/FAF has very little during the life of the project. Rehabilitalitation plans have been drawn and a local contractor is to carry out the work rather than having it done under the supervision of the project personnel.\n3. Rehabilitation, except at the MU/FAF, has progressed very well but there is still much that needs to be done that will not be covered under the present project. For example, there is no rehabilitation now scheduled for the Namulonge Research Station which is to be the main station for annual food crops.\n4. While the rehabilitation has, by and large, been carried out very well and with excellent supervision by the Management Assistants, there is little assurance, at least in the short run, that the implementing agencies will have either the trained manpower or the financial resources to maintain the facilities and equipment. Corrective measures must be taken in the design of the next phase of the project, as well as in negotiations between USAID and the GOU, to assure support for maintenance. This will need to include appropriate salaries to attract and hold the skilled technicians who are required for service and maintenance.\n5. The retraining of staff has been carried out as planned and 32 staff persons from MU/FAF and 35 from the MA have received short-term training in the United States or at one of the IARCs. There has been little follow-up on the trainees since their return from training and the absence of any equipment or financial support for them on their return has negated any hope for early application of knowledge or new capability acquired as part of their training.\n6. The development of a food crop research strategy and implementation of a viable agricultural research program is still in a very preliminary stage. The Agricultural Research Advisor is working closely with the Chief Agricultural Research Officer, who was appointed in the MA as one of the project requirements, to bring about better planning, execution, monitoring, and reporting of agricultural research. \n7. In regard to \"assistance to the MU/FAFW there does not appear to have been any significant action by the Contractor in regard to curricula and staff development plans. Also, there was no action by the Contractor or the FAF on the identification and training of \"Extension Specialists\" for the six departments of the FAF as had been agreed under the project. There is little evidence of any strengthening of linkages between research and extension or between the MA and the MU/FAF.",

      "Document Title": "Mid-Term Evaluation Report: Agricultural Research  and Production Project",
      "Key Findings": "1. To strengthen the agricultural research system and to increase its effectiveness, the ARP Project introduced changes within the existing organization of the research system. The creation of four new bodies: the Research Coordination Committee, the National Agricultural Research Services Center (NARSC), the Farming Systems Division, and the Socio-Economics Division were part of the institution-building process. The development of these institutions by HMG has proceeded to a greater degree than what was envisioned in the Project Paper. In many respects, this indicates the commitment that HMG (His Majesty's Government of Nepal) is making towards the restructuring and strengthening of the agricultural research system. \n\nHowever, the increased responsibility of NARSC to incorporate all agricultural research programs including the research farms/stations previously under the Department of Agriculture and NARSCs transfer to the MOA (Ministry of Agriculture) has clouded the linkages with and within the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Livestock and Animal Health. While these linkages need to be re-defined and re-established and indeed are being re-established, the Project and the Contractor have tended to concentrate their efforts in the more production-oriented hill and seed programs. \n\n2. Building upon the work of the ICP (Integrated Cereal Project) and SPIS (Seed Production & Input Storage) projects, the ARP Project is continuing to strengthen the systems approach via the use of the farming systems methodology and the input of socio-economists into the research process. This approach is practical and viable for the testing and development of suitable technologies for Nepal.\n\n3. The project activities in the Hill Production Program to date have not had any appreciable impact nor is it likely that any impact from this program can be achieved in the remaining project period. The existence of a separate \"ARPP\" program within the district's own production program raises questions of sustainability and viability.\n\n4. The present Seed Production Program has developed through a series of changes and alterations based on implementation experience started in the SPIS project. The present form of this program now appears to be a very effective method for promoting the multiplication and distribution of i.nproved seed varieties In remote areas.\n\n5. Project coordination, monitoring, and reporting have been major weak areas within the project. Project monitoring plans have been created which describe the process but not the method. Monitoring plans which provide methods of indicating 'research success' in terms of achievements need to be developed.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Since the RCC and NARSC have been elevated to the MOA, the Project Director should be transferred to the Chief of NARSC and the Project Coordinator should be appointed from a staff member within the MOA preferably with a research background. Likewise, Winrock International (WI) should provide research management assistance in the form of a number of short-term consultants, the terms of reference to be decided by joint consultations. All Project assistance should be routed through NARSC.\n2. Both the FSRDD (Farming Systems Research & Development Division) and SERED (Socio-economic Research & Extension Division) need to be made permanent within the HMG system. In addition, permanent staff should be provided to ensure that the activities planned by these divisions can be implemented effectively. Operational and logistic support from ARPP should be supportive in helping to establish linkages between these divisions and the other research programs/offices. FSRDD and SERED's roles in the Outreach Program activities need to be developed so that they are complementary and work to close the gap between research and extension.\n3. The technology testing program in the four hill districts should become a part of the Outreach Programs of the Lumle Agriculture Center (LAC) and the Lamepatan Livestock Farm. It is anticipated that an agreement will be signed between the MOA and LAC which would allow LAC to assume the prime responsibility for research activities in this region. This would include the development and testing of appropriate technologies and the technical assistance required to transfer these to the extension-based production programs through the ADO's offices.\n4. The Project should continue both financial and technical assistance support to the Seed Program to expand it to other districts and to create a \"packaged\" program inclusive of organization plans, training materials, etc., which could be easily implemented by other projects and donors in other parts of the country. Additional work needs to be done on the incorporation of the Mini-Seed Houses into the private producer/seller seed program once the MOA makes a policy decision regarding their ownership and use. ARPP support to the National Seed Board needs to be provided through Increased logistical and technical support.\n5. A new monitoring and evaluation plan needs to be developed by ARPP/WI to reflect 1) the changes In the project as a result of the proposed restructuring and 2) to develop adequate indicators for measuring project impact. The Project Coordinator needs to be given a defined role and his position should be elevated to a level where he has overall responsibility for everyday Project management. The\nWI Chief of Party should report to and work with the Coordinator as a counterpart. The Coordinator's Office should also be responsible for the coordination of the Peace Corps staff assigned to the Project.",

      "Document Title": "The National Agricultural Development Project in Jordan- Final Evaluation and Impact Assessment",
      "Key Findings": "One of the principal achievements of the project was the establishment of the semiautonomous National Center for Agricultural Research and Technology Transfer WCARlT) with its six regional agricultural services centers. NCARlT and these services centers are the principal subjects of the final evaluation.\n\n1. While anecdotal evidence shows that some farmers have adopted practices based on NCARTT (National Center for Agricultural Research and Technology Transfer) research, the transfer of technology to the average farmer has been weak.\n2. The project design contained many good ideas but could have been improved by giving increased emphasis on: achieving fully autonomous status for NCARTT, or some other flexible mechanism, to resolve the low salary and short workday problems; providing for much greater\nparticipation by the private sector to guide NCARTT's research programs; building a constituency to lobby for governmental policy reforms and budgetary support; and, the early elaboration of an agricultural research and technology transfer strategy to set the context and direction for NCARTT programs.\n3. The consumption and equipping of the four regional agricultural services centers and the National Center building at Baq'a were and still are, far behind schedule. The delays in construction and the lack of proper sequencing of events (construction, staff training, and\nordering and arrival of the equipment), have most definitely hampered NCARTT's ability to conduct research, transfer technology, and provide needed services to the agricultural sector.\n4. The Agricultural Research Strategy and Medium Term Plan represent an important first step in defining research needs and priorities.\n5. The Training Program has been quite ambitious and successful involving a significant number of women.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Identification, Development, Motivation, and Retention of High-Quality Personnel-\n1. The NCARTT Council should continue to push for legal full-autonomy, or some other flexible mechanism, to allow them to offer competitive salaries and benefits packages and to establish a working environment conducive to high levels of performance.\n2. NCARTT should undertake a continuing effort to identify and recruit the highest quality employees through contacts with university staff, vacation employment programs for upper-level university students, and by offering opportunities for M.Sc. candidates to conduct their thesis work under NCARTT tutelage.\n3. NCARTT should reduce its professional and support staff to a level that allows it to offer competitive salaries and professional upgrading opportunities within anticipated budgetary resources.\n\nNCARTT Institutional Sustainability-\n1. NCARTT should seek funding for joint research activities with local organizations such as the two universities with faculties of agriculture (University of Jordan and JUST), the HCST, and the Royal Scientific Society should most likely be the NCARTT's first priority in the short run.\n\nResearch Program Focus, Prioritization, and Monitoring-\n1. The NCARTT Council and management should work with the Ministry of Agriculture, Faculties of Agriculture, and the private sector to assure that the system for defining agricultural research priorities devotes sufficient attention to internal and external market demand and potential, and to cost-reducing technologies and quality control measures to improve the competitiveness of Jordan's agricultural products in domestic, regional, and European markets.\n2. The NCARTT Council and management should establish a process for formal involvement of farmers in the identification and prioritization of specific problems requiring research by NCARTT.\n\nTechnology Transfer-\n1. NCARTT should strengthen its capacity to carry out an expanded program of technology transfer, employing a variety of media and techniques to disseminate technology to many different technology transfer agents including Ministry of Agriculture extension personnel, innovative farmer leaders, Jordan Cooperative Organization employees, Ministry of Agriculture plant production and plant protection personnel, owners and employees of agricultural supply firms, nursery owners and employees, custom equipment operators, instructors and students from the Faculties of Agriculture at the University of Jordan and JUST as well as vocational agricultural schools.\n\nUse of NCARTTlregional agricultural services Laboratories-\n1. NCARTT should form a committee b make a careful analysis of the numbers and kinds of laboratories that are essential to its research and technology transfer activities, both at the national headquarters, including the old and the new building, and at the regional agricultural services centers.\n2. If the needed laboratories are to function, they will require a trained cadre of technicians for their operation and maintenance which is currently lacking.\n\nPrivate Sector Participation-\n1. NCARTT should institutionalize a process for formally involving fanners in the identification and prioritization of research needs.\n2. USAID/Jordan and the Government of Jordan should consider providing funding to establish a research grants fund to address production and marketing research needs which would\nbe administered by the Exporters' Association of Fresh Fruits and Vegetables.\n\nFuture Directions for NCARTT-\n1. NCARTT should reduce its staff and program to a level at which its budget is adequate to employ a smaller, better-paid, top-quality staff that can carry out carefully selected, high-priority research activities.\n2. NCARTT should place much greater emphasis on research that addresses the problems related to water availability and quality such as studies on water harvesting, use of treated waste water in irrigation, problems associated with salinity and heavy metals, and crops and practices that are appropriate for low rainfall, low soil-moisture conditions.",

      "Document Title": "Evaluation of the Kibaale Forest Conservation and Management Project Under the Action Program for Program for the Environment",
      "Key Findings": "The Kibale Forest Project has had an ambitious agenda to help develop Ugandan capacity to manage the Kibale Forest (now Kibale National Park) and to nurture the continued development of the Makerere University Biological Field Station (MUBFS). Supported with substantial USAlD/Kampala funding, the project has been well-justified by the valuable history of research at MUBFS and by the considerable potential for the station to develop into the premier African center for research and training in forest biodiversity conservation and management; by the substantial but largely unrealized potential for primate and forest-based ecotourism in Kibale that could benefit both park management and local communities; and by the clear need for technical assistance to help local communities derive measurable benefits from the intact forest. However, the project's implementation has been thwarted by numerous constraints: among them, very poorly defined and increasingly difficult relationships between cooperating institutions and project personnel, limited financial administration provided by Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), slow disbursement of USAID funds to the project, early departures of personnel from key project positions with very slow replacement, turnover in Ugandan institutional authority over the forest, and limited [mancial and institutional investment in the field station by Makerere University.\n\nDespite these considerable challenges, several significant project objectives have been achieved:\n• Substantial infrastructure development at MUBFS, enhancing its capacity to serve as a center for tropical forest science research and training.\n• Increased levels of applied conservation research and training at the station, with moderate participation of Ugandan students and scientists.\n• In and out park tourism development in place with demonstrable economic benefits to local communities.\n• Markedly increased local support for forest conservation.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. USAIDlKampala should continue to support the development of Kibale National Park and the Makerere University Biological Field Station.\n2. USAID should support (a) training, infrastructure development, research and community environmental education at MUBFS, and (b) capacity-building for Uganda National Parks to sustainably manage Kibale National Park and develop support for the park in buffer-zone communities. These should be treated as discrete activities and probably funded through two separate institutions.\n.3 During the no greater than 12 month bridging period, USAID funding for MUBFS should focus on basic station infrastructure improvement, continuity of field courses and improved coordination of research and training objectives with KNP.\n4. Makerere University (MU) should strengthen its financial, technical and administrative support for MUBFS.\n5. Beyond the bridge, Makerere University should form a consortium with one or more qualified universities and possibly conservation NGO's to operate MUBFS for the next several years.\n6. The consortium should appoint one person as MUBFS director, with a strong technical background, significant international experience, and substantial management and leadership skills.\n7. Greater efforts should be made to increase participation of Ugandan and other African students and scientists in MUBFS research and training.\n8. MU and UNP should develop a Memorandum of understanding that guarantees the continued development of MUBFS as a center for both basic and management-oriented research and training.\n9. UNP should immediately begin preparing a Kibale National Park management plan.\n10. Beyond the bridge, USAID support for KNP should be provided to UNP in collaboration with an NGO with technical expertise in forest park management and community-based tourism/environmental education.\n11. A senior technical advisor to KNP with park management and nature tourism development\nexpertise should be provided through follow-on project activities.\n12. USAID should continue to support community-based tourism in and near Kibale.\n13. Support should be provided for increased KNP protection and monitoring of wildlife 'in the former game corridor between Kibale and Queen Elizabeth Park.\n14. USAID should support mCN activities that seek to reduce human pressure on the Kibale National Park through the involvement of local communities in sustainable resource management.",

The training, scientific backstopping and resources that\nSAFGRAD provided to the NARS, enabled them to increase their\nresearch outputs significantly, both qualitatively and\nquantitatively. As a result, a strong linkage was established\nbetween NARS scientists and farmers through extension workers, nongovernment organizations and farmer organizations.\n5.

      "Document Title": "Midterm Evaluation of the Natural Resources Based Agricultural Research Project (NRBAR)",
      "Key Findings": "1. The Natural Resources Based Agricultural Research Project (NRBAR) is restrictive in comparison to the Senegalese Institute for Agricultural Research (ISRA) scope of action in the area of agricultural research. Indeed, since ISRA research activities are conducted throughout the national territory and cover all the products and agricultural production systems, there is a problem of compatibility with the limits fixed at the outset by NRBAR project whose interventions were restricted to 4 crops and to areas where rainfall exceeds 400 mm. Furthermore, the geographical location of some members of the technical assistance team who are separated from their counterparts, and the existence of distinct NRBAR/CID offices, makes NRBAR look more like a separate entity. There is also insufficient coordination for the achievement of NRBAR activities and insufficient acceptance of responsibilities by certain counterparts. \n2. Implementation of the research planning and organization component seems to have had the greatest impact on both ISRA's institutional and scientific consolidation. By improving the quality of research and planning organization of the Institute, the actions taken have undoubtedly contributed to the institutionalization of practices which definitely improve the scientific and technical performance of its programs.\n3. The NRBAR project has made a significant contribution to the design of ISRA's Natural Resources Management program. The contribution has to a large extent enabled: the establishment of the program planning committee, the design of a Geographical Information System, the design of a natural resources-based research strategy.\n4. Despite the faltering noted at the beginning, the research and development program contributed to the improvement of ISRA's institutional capability with the tools and mechanisms it put at its disposal. They are:\n- Design, management, and monitoring instruments for the grant research actions;\n- Institution of regular progress report mechanisms\n- Institution of regular visits to the test sites by partner groups and ad hoc committees\n- Participatory evaluation of each campaign test results to assess all the lessons learned in order to improve on decisions\n5. As regards ISRA's financial management system, the Ernst and Young Firm has made enough progress despite the lack of monitoring and of supervision by ISRA. The shortcomings are: incomplete inventory of ISRA's needs in the areas of processing and monitoring, insufficient involvement of ISRA users in the system design, inadequacy of the proposed strategy for ISRA's actual needs in matters of financial management.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. - Appoint a single counterpart for each technical assistant.\n- Integrate technical assistance as a whole into ISRA structure by having the technical assistants and their counterparts \"work in the same location in order to get used to working together.\n- Enhance consultation and exchange of information among the technical assistants and their counterparts and the various components of the NRBAR project through regular consultation meetings.\n- Institute within each Binomial (technical assistance team member/ISRA counterpart), the establishment of mandatory work plans and of regular activities programs with a clear division of tasks.\n2. ISRA, in conjunction with the NRBAR technical\nassistance team, and while making the necessary arrangements to\nthis end, takes advantage of the scientific management and\ninstitutional tools like the Geographical Information System, the\nMonitoring Evaluation Plan and the Natural Resource-Based\nResearch Strategic Plan developed with the Project assistance.\n3. - Consolidate project experience in the implementation of several research activities regarding the technologies to be tested on-farm in order to be validated and/or adopted in relation to the activities with the different actors in a workshop which would appraise the achievements and the steps to be taken to carry out more effective actions and to give a more appropriate direction to the next programs.\n- Complete the grant activity submission protocols so that in the next programs the nature and the type of the planned activities (validation/ adoption or others) are specified, the technology to be developed determined and characterized, and the time frame for the program implementation adjusted to its type and nature.\n- Scale down and redefine the collaborative research activities so as to have the population as a whole solely involved in the adoption activities. The validation of technologies should be placed under the exclusive responsibility of the researcher who may set them up in carefully selected plots.\n- There is a very limited number of technologies currently implemented in the program. At this pace/ the project is very unlikely to completely achieve its objective.",

Intensive pre-departure training and carefully elaborated follow-on activities have guaranteed high-level impact by returned Peace Scholars on the economy and the promotion of social change.\n3. Through the CAPS/HOPS-II project, more than 3,000 Honduran leaders have been trained through academic and technical programs.\n4. 39% of the persons trained were women. A greater effort must be made to increase female participation to 50%.\n5. The training program staff need to improve communications and collaboration with the Mission in general, and specifically with the Mission technical offices.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1) There is a need for more active recruitment of women, adopting a 50 percent participation rate for women, as well as increased lead time during the recruitment process. Concerning the selection process, HOPS-II was commended for introducing the week-long selection seminar. The seminar should be maintained and should, as a\nmodel, be shared with other CLASP Missions. The CAPSIHOPS staff must make a greater effort to ensure the participation of women as scholarship recipients, formally establishing 50 percent female participation as a program goal.\n2) Pre-departure training should be shortened and oriented toward the objective of supporting U.S. training, with improved communication with U.S. training institutions. For long-term trainees, more emphasis should be placed on English proficiency to pass the TOEFL, with more information about the U.S. academic system. Competing for program\ncomponents during pre-departure training should be reduced. For short-term trainees, competency-based objectives should be modified to provide survival English, and the \"Experience America\" component should be executed through appropriate program design, not through English competency.\n3) Pre-departure orientation should include a stronger experiential cross-cultural orientation for all trainees, and long-term trainees should receive clearer guidelines about the types of non-academic activities available at U.S. universities.\n4) The training design process should include a wider range of interested parties to ensure that the training plan developed for the training provider is directly related to the candidates' needs. In addition, group training plans should project expected results with respect to trainee participation in volunteer activities, against which outcomes can be assessed.\n5) Support should be maintained for the regional associations, for leadership seminars, and for linkages between short and long-term trainees. The Mission should continue to provide support for the CAPSIHOPS follow-on activities which have ensured substantive impact as a result of training.\n6) In view of budget cutbacks, future training should be co-funded with Mission technical offices.\n7) The training program staff needs to improve communications and collaboration with the Mission in general, and specifically with the Mission's technical offices. The CAPSIHOPS project should develop strategies leading to improved communication of its activities and accomplishments within the Mission, and with other scholarship\nprograms in the region. The CAPSIHOPS office should establish more regular internal communications with the technical offices and other divisions within the Mission, and emphasize the degree to which HOPS-II can serve as a support mechanism to the technical fields. The Office of Education and Training and the CAPSIHOPS staff may wish\nto develop more explicitly in memoranda or in presentations how HOPS-II supports Mission strategic objectives.\n8) Attention should be paid to balancing training themes, within the limits of program constraints, so that fields in which relatively few women are employed will not predominate. Assessments of training needs should be cognizant of country trends and not prejudge women's choices of study. Gender sensitivity should be addressed during the cross-cultural training of the predeparture orientation program when both men and women can learn about U.S. female-male interactions. Cultural discriminatory constraints should be discussed with men and women during the pre-departure orientation program.",

Participants were from the private and public sectors, although the Project emphasized the private sector.\nThe Project offered training opportunities on both a long and short-term basis and introduced the trainees to the social, political, and cultural values in the United States.\n\nThis training Project, in addition to the new knowledge and skills, gave the trainees a new vision of themselves, with increased confidence and a greater sense of responsibility, a new view of the world, being more open minded and aware of the many options available. Knowledge of the English language enabled the trainees to get better jobs, obtain promotions, and increased incomes\n\nTo allow the participation by national, provincial, and local leaders, the geographic scope of the program was broad. Special attention was given to achieve a high level of participation of the economically disadvantaged, women, and members of the minority population groups, which had not received sufficient support in the past.\n\n",

      "Key Findings": "Since its creation in June 1994, the Association for the Strengthening of Agricultural Research in East and Central Africa (ASARECA) has undertaken a large number of activities in pursuit of broad objectives. The major important accomplishments include (a) the delivery of reports by five working groups, (b) the incorporation of four existing research networks into ASARECA's ongoing operations, and (c) the review and evaluation of other research efforts.\n\nASARECA's own deliberative processes have now produced a substantial volume of information, analysis, and programmatic recommendations concerning research priorities and associated cross-cutting needs. These deliberations will continue and even gather momentum, especially as new Networks are formed and the existing regional Networks and Task Forces adjust to and refine the findings of the Priorities Working Group. For the next two years or so, the need to sift through programmatic options and develop sound and responsive programs will demand a great deal of time, attention, and resources on the part of ASARECA and its stakeholders.\n\nA great deal of agriculture research capacity exists in the university systems of the ASARECA countries. There are more Ph.D. holders in the agriculture faculties than in the ASARECA NARIs. A dialogue with the Deans of Agriculture ofASARECA member countries has begun in connection with the review of the report of the Human Resources Development Working Group.\n\nThe main task for ASARECA over the next three years is the development of its regional program. This will mainly evolve from the foundation of projects, project ideas, and programmatic recommendations that have been generated by ASARECA deliberative processes and dialogues with stakeholders.",

      "Key Findings": "1.  With rare exceptions, pupil performance in intensive intervention schools was significantly better than pupil performance in non-intensive intervention schools.\n2. Demonstrating Potential: The IEQ Project has discovered the untapped potential of educators within the system. Our experience suggests that educational improvement is sparked when people become engaged in the process of reform. IEQ has debunked some myths about teacher disinterest, community turnover of education to teachers, etc., and it has shown that the infrastructure of a system may be strengthened to bring about indigenous reform.\n3. Building Capacity: Both institutional and individual capacity is strengthened through IEQ. The heart of IEQ lies in each partner country, as institutions \"host\" IEQ teams. The local teams carry the bulk of the workload and have added new skills to their professional repertoire, such as the use of qualitative research methods.\n4. Opening Doors:  All participants are part of the learning curve. The project staff have seen that the key to improvement rests with recognizing one's relationship to other pieces of the system. When information is both shared and made public, it brings new people into the dialogue (parents, teachers, regional educators) and suggests new roles for some of them, e.g., circuit supervisors and head teachers become instructional resources, not \"inspectors.\n5. . Creating Knowledge: IEQ creates new knowledge as information flows within and across the system. The key is how the information is presented, shared, and used. It must be \"user friendly\" and audience-specific.\n6. Developing Research Tools: IEQ host-country research teams have used qualitative and quantitative methods to capture what is happening in the classroom. They have developed a variety of techniques for assessment: achievement measures in numeracy and literacy; interview protocols for parents, pupils, local and regional supervisors, and community members; classroom observation forms which describe interactions among pupils and between teachers and pupils; instructional materials; and information on the learning environment.",

      "Document Title": "Implementation Completion Report, Srilanka: Agricultural Research Project",
      "Key Findings": "The development of research capacity of the institutes in the NARS of Sri Lanka has been uneven and fragmented. The absence of a national research policy and of a long-term vision for future has been a major factor affecting the overall performance. The expectation that the CARP would assume leadership of and credibility among the institutions of the NARS without dynamic and respected leaders and an inbuilt dependency of the institutions on the CARP and without control of the funds was misplaced. CARP would require fundamental changes to overcome inherent institutional and functional weaknesses in order to evolve into an institution of utility and importance. CARP should also have some control over budget allocation within the NARS. The NARP, despite the range of details on the research system. lacks a vision for the future development of the whole research system. Such a vision should, inter alia, outline the changing demands for technology, the expected roles of the public and private sectors, and the role of the universities. The vision should also analyze future scenarios for funding research and identify needed changes in the public research sector to promote greater efficiency. The value of CADMAR and INFORM has been clearly demonstrated, but these management tools were not utilized by all institutes. Further technical assistance support would be required to ensure the sustainability of these tools. The contract research program has been partially successful. However, it provides an essential means for sponsoring inter-institutional research, mobilizing the greatly under-utilized research resources of the universities, promoting joint research with the private sector, and encouraging strategic and upstream research in key areas and should be continued",
      "Key Recommendations": "(a) A vision statement of the future evolution of the research system should be a precondition for Bank support to a new lending program for agricultural research; \n(b) Greater consideration should be given at appraisal to aspects of institutional consolidation especially when the NARS is fragmented and when salaries are low and operational costs are scarce; \n(c) The expectation that the CARP would assume leadership of and credibility among the institutions of the NARS without dynamic and respected leaders and an inbuilt dependency of the institutions on the CARP and without control of the funds was misplaced; \n(d) The emphasis of the project on human resources development training, strategic provision of equipment, and provision of good housing were important factors in achieving a highly competent and motivated scientific staff, which is particularly important in attracting and retaining staff at more remote research institutes; \n(e) Considerable savings could be made if the training program is administered by an efficient project management unit instead of external consultants and if the split-training program is fostered; and\n(f) Contract research administered by a central body, when appropriately managed, provides an essential means for sponsoring inter-institutional research, mobilizing the greatly under-utilized research resources of the universities, promoting joint research with the private sector, and encouraging strategic and upstream research in key areas.",

In the context of national development goals specified in the Namibian Constitution and the First National Development Plan, and in view of the paramount importance of human resource development, a new portfolio, namely Higher Education, Vocational Training, Science and Technology, was created within the Government of Namibia. Among the many tasks of this portfolio is overseeing the development of the higher education system as an engine of human resource development. \n\nThe development of the higher education system must be responsive to the needs for human resources in our society as it draws on public funding to create, maintain and sometimes eliminate programs within the institutions of higher learning. To promote the development of the higher education system there is a need for a public policy guide: a higher education policy frame in the form of a White Paper on Higher Education.\n\nTo be useful, policy statements must result from a consultative and participatory process in which those responsible for the policy and those affected by the policy have opportunities to express their concerns, propose analytic perspectives and courses of action, and criticize and respond to others contributions. Policy consultations are often unruly and lengthy. Without them, however, policy statements are likely to remain just that, official documents to which people occasionally refer but which may have little impact on day-to-day behavior.",
