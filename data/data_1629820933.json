      "Key Findings": "During the 3-year period of the project implementation, Vaccines for Theileriosis have been developed and successfully tested under laboratory and field conditions. The vaccine from one of the stations is being commercially marketed. The University of Illinois technology for the production of the Babesiosis vaccine was successfully implemented at one station. Introduced technology for the production of Anaptasmosis vaccine Is under development. Field applicable serodiagnostic procedures for each of the three diseases have been developed and used for epidemiologic studies and follow-tip of immune responses to vaccines.",
      "Key Recommendations": "It is recommended that an arrangement be made to test the application of a triple vaccine during the remaining period of the subproject. The trials should be conducted on at least 4 geographic locations using calves 2 to 6 months of age. Theileria and Babesia vaccines should be produced in India and this consult should make arrangements for the provision of a modified-live Anaplasma vaccine from the U.S.A.",

Further, Genuine partnership and mutual trust is a prerequisite for the sustainable transfer of technology from developed to developing countries. In addition, building local scientific capacity and long-term North-South and South-South partnerships are important in establishing effective health research programs. The research topics should have local relevance and priority and technology transfer should be participatory, equitable, and sustained.  Finally, the \nautonomous research centers attract funding and reduce administrative burdens",

Almost all of the recommendations, with regard to program offerings, internal management, and budgeting, offered in the 1994 evaluation have been addressed. Program in recent years has focused on training for rural health workers, primary school teachers and construction managers which reflects increased attention to USAID strategic priorities. Students from disadvantaged and underserved populations have been recruited.\nA strong positive impact on the participating colleges, their U.S. students and the people in the surrounding towns and cities have been observed.",
      "Key Recommendations": "The project should explore the possibility of increasing contributions to the program. Explore and invest in low-cost options to increase Cooperative Association of States Scholarships (CASS) visibility in the participating countries. CASS should examine ways to expand its networks with other organizations in each country that may provide resources and funding to underwrite scholarship costs. the creation of an internet-based directory of alumni should be considered. Strengthen the cooperation between CASS and USAID on the selection of areas of study and in other areas. \nContinue to explore ways to facilitate the transfer of college credits to institutions in the\nhome countries.",

      "Document Title": "West and Central African Maize Collaborative Research Network (WECAMAN): Synthesis Report on WECAMAN for the period 1997 to 2002",
      "Key Findings": "WECAMAN has been very successful in stimulating the capability and initiatives of national scientists to solve maize production problems and to generate and/or identify and transfer\nappropriate technologies to end-users. The sustainable technologies emanating from research efforts of the Network include open-pollinated maize varieties with resistance /tolerance to  Striga, drought and streak, including early and extra-early varieties for drought prone areas; post-harvest methods; and crop management practices.\nThe extra-early variety TZEE-W SR BC5 has been released in seven countries while the early and drought tolerant variety Pool 16 DT has been released in six countries through on-farm tests and\ndemonstrations funded in WECAMAN member countries since 1994. To date, a total of 20 extra early and 30 early varieties are available to farmers in WCA through WECAMAN. Obatanpa, a\nquality protein maize (QPM) variety with good nitrogen use efficiency that was developed in Ghana, is being vigorously promoted by WECAMAN in the sub-region. This variety has been\nreleased or slated for release in all the member countries.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Most of the widely adopted maize varieties in WCA are not endowed with the quality protein trait available in QPM germplasm. On the other hand many highly productive QPM germplasm are yet to be improved for resistance to the maize streak virus, Striga, drought, storage pests and stem borers. There is therefore a need to intensify the effort at developing and disseminating high\nyielding, Striga, streak and drought resistant extra-early, early and intermediate QPM varieties for the production conditions of WCA \n\nThere is also a need to support sustainable seed production of\nQPM seed. To ensure increased and sustained maize production and productivity in WCA that will lead to increased food security, improved nutrition and incomes of the people of WCA, WECAMAN and IITA propose a new phase of the USAlD project of WECAMAN. The project will build on the achievement made by the Network and bring the results to a larger proportion of the target beneficiaries for whom maize is a major staple and source of income.",

      "Key Findings": "This article reviews the available evidence on private sector utilization and quality of care. It provides a framework for analysing the private sector’s influence on child health outcomes. This influence goes beyond service provision by private providers and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). Pharmacies, drug sellers, private suppliers, and food producers also have an impact on the health of children. Many governments are experimenting with strategies to engage the private sector to improve child health.",
      "Key Recommendations": "The article analyses some of the most promising strategies, and suggests that a number of constraints make it hard for policy-makers to emulate these approaches. Few experiences are clearly described, monitored, and evaluated. The article suggests that improving the impact of child health programmes in developing countries requires a more systematic analysis of how to engage the private sector most effectively. The starting point should include the evaluation of the presence and potential of the private sector, including actors such as professional associations, producer organizations, community groups, and patients’ organizations.",

      "Key Findings": "Increases in agriculture sector production and income will become more dependent on technology\nfrom research as time passes. As the availability of cultivable new land decreases and rural population\ngrowth continues, yields and value-added along the chain from grower to final consumer must\nincrease per unit of cultivated land in order even to maintain current levels of welfare. Agricultural\nresearch must not only improve its output of technology in response to farmer needs, but also address\nthe market-derived demands of economic actors all along the processing chain. At the same time\nmore investigation and investment is needed to identify and mitigate barriers to effective transfer and\ndissemination of new technologies. Much of this research must focus on ways that farmers and other\nactors can act together to secure needed inputs, financing, production support services normally\nprovided by governments and government policy responses to their needs. Important strides made in\nimproving communications and collaboration between the agricultural research community and its\nmany stakeholders must continue and improve.",

      "Key Findings": "Compared to what was anticipated at the time of the MTR, NARC has been unable to fully institutionalize the\nnecessary organizational and procedural reforms needed to meet the ultimate goal of developing new location\nspecific agricultural technology; while the activities of the extension component have not yet led to the widespread\nadoption of improved service delivery mechanisms. The project has therefore only partially met the reform targets\nwhich were fundamental to achieving the objective of improving the management and capacity of agricultural\nresearch and extension services, and as a result, the project outcome is rated as unsatisfactory. To a considerable\nextent these shortfalls in achievement can be also attributed to the fact that institutional reform within the public\nsector always takes time, especially if it is expected that this will be generated to some extent from within the\norganization. In the end there was just not enough time left in the second half of the project to institutionalize\nmany of the new initiatives coming from the MTR. There is every reason to believe, however, that if funds had\nbeen available and the field security situation had improved to make an extension of the project possible, then the\noverall achievement of project objective might eventually have been satisfactory.",
      "Key Recommendations": "The design and preparation of projects must be based on broad-based stakeholder participation. \nThe need for a Project Coordination Unit should be carefully assessed on a project-by-project basis. \nCredit funds should be canceled judiciously.\nThe need for technical assistance, especially long-term consultancies, must be critically assessed, and where it is needed, it must be fielded on time, and preferably be grant financed.\nHigher-level training should be undertaken as early as possible in the life of a project.",

      "Key Findings": "The project was evaluated in terms of (1) the effectiveness of the EdNet project in achieving intended results in the area of networking; (2) the impact of EdNet activity on the development of higher education in Central Asia: (3) lessons learned from the nationwide testing initiative in Kyrgyzstan and (4) the issue of EdNet sustainability.\n1. The EdNet project has achieved significant results in terms of institutional members. and enhancing meaningful networking among member institutions and their faculty members. The level of intellectual exchange among HEIs in the region has grown demonstrably. and information collected from system participants supports the conclusion that EdNet seminars, conferences and other learning events have strengthened the economics and business departments in the region. The membership size remains an issue. but the issue is amenable to analysis, given the available membership data and the near-term objectives of the EdSet project.\n2. The most significant EdNet achievements are to be found in the efforts to improve teaching by helping faculty learn new content and new teaching skills. EdNet has provided an extensive array of educational services - educational materials, grants for economic research. case writing competitions, training in the EdNet Academy, and Visiting International Professors (VIPs). Survey results from both EdNet institutional representatives and faculty members indicated that\nall of the services have been useful and have contributed to improvements in teaching and research in business and economics departments.\n3. EdNet no longer has responsibility for the testing program in\nKyrgyzstan. The program will continue under the direction of another contractor. However. the initial phases of the initiative have been considered very successful, and all respondents (with one exception) indicated that testing was extremely important to future of education in Kyrgyzstan. Turkmenistan was deemed the least likely to implement such an initiative. Tajikistan and Uzbekistan were considered only somewhat likely to succeed.\n4. EdNet sustainability is a big issue. Although EdNet objectives can and have been largely achieved, it is necessary to review organizational and financial options that will assist in the continuation of the project after the cessation of USAID. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "Provide more support to ENA faculty after they complete their coursework. During interviews with several EdNet institutional representatives, it was suggested that there should be more follow-on activities for graduates of the EdNet Academy. As noted in questionnaire responses, the training received is very important, and highly valued by the participant and their home institutions. However, equally (and perhaps more) important is access to information needed for course development activities.\n\nSome journal subscriptions to EdNet institutions departments of business and economics are highly recommended. Most business and economics disciplines now have journals devoted to the pedagogical aspects of the discipline. For example, the Financial Management Association (FMA) publishes a quarterly journal entitled Financial Education.\n\nExpand organizational and financial support for activities designed to support the development of academic accreditation under international standards. The Central Asian Management Development Association (CAMAN) has widely publicized its accreditation activities. However, available budget information and conversations with people who are familiar with the accreditation situation in the CAR, suggest that EdNet has provided much of the funding necessary to encourage accreditation and international standards in the region.\n",

This, along with the economic and strategic interests of dominant groups in the advanced capitalist countries (and Africa), has largely shaped development policies and programs in Africa.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Scholars and development researchers should re-examine their work on Africa in order to be able to expose and critique knowledge and ways of knowing.

      "Document Title": "Facilitating Transfer of Technology to  Developing Countries:  A Survey of Home-Country Measures",
      "Key Findings": "UNCTAD has surveyed 41 agencies and programmes in 23 developed countries that offer home-country measures (HCMs), in one way or another, facilitating technology transfer (see table 1). HCMs are often provided as part of international cooperation programmes and/or strategic trade and investment initiatives.\n\nNineteen of the agencies surveyed provide support for training programmes. Of these, four provide support to enable affiliates of home-country firms in developing countries train their workers, three provide training as part of matching services and five run independent\nskills development programmes.\n\nFifteen of the agencies surveyed provide FDI-related technology transfer incentives to their enterprises. Of these 15, five require their firms to seek partnership with local firms, four include training of local partners or workers as a requirement and three require a demonstration that transfer of technology does take place. Similarly, 10 of the agencies provide technology transfer related matchmaking services. \n\nSeven of the agencies surveyed provide financing for technology transfer. Of these, three have dedicated financing mechanisms to facilitate technology transfer. Further, four of the agencies surveyed provide venture capital support to firms in developing countries or in\npartnership with home-country firms.\n\nSome of the HCMs illustrated above provide examples of best practices in facilitating technology transfer. Overall, the existing home-country programmes are fragmented, insufficient and narrow in coverage. For instance, the number of programmes whose core objective is technology transfer is small, and only a few countries are covered. Although many agencies recognize FDI as a channel for technology transfer, few include requirements to ensure technology transfer does take place in their FDI-related incentives. There is also limited information on HCMs facilitating technology transfer.",
      "Key Recommendations": "There is still a vast scope for further efforts. Such efforts may include assistance to developing countries to improve technical standards and certification systems, extensive dissemination of information on HCMs, mobilization of “business angels” and involvement of developing country firms in complex projects. Home countries may also reserve a portion of their technical assistance budget to developing countries to support measures facilitating technology transfer to small businesses, especially in LDCs.",

Although competitiveness is a firm level phenomenon, macroeconomic and microeconomic environments influence market signals. Removing supply-side constraint to trade and investment, require firms to build up their competitive advantages. However, competitive advantage is measured in relation to rivals in the markets firms compete in. Integration into regional and global trade and investment networks will require much effort, although it is not an impossible proposition. Donors (OECD and others) have much to contribute to this process. They can help to expedite the learning processes involved by sharing good practices, they can technically and financially assist transition and developing countries in overcoming barriers, most importantly, they can ensure that improved market access complements improved competitiveness of SMEs.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Embed strategies toward the private sector and SMEs in countries’ broader national development and poverty reduction programmes. Encourage and help SME associations to participate effectively in national dialogues that help set the strategic frameworks for development, so that the contribution and the policy and support needs of SMEs are fully recognised as central to growth, employment and poverty reduction.\nStrengthen SME capacities to improve their competitiveness in domestic, regional and global markets. Encourage and support private sector associations and enterprises able to provide information on markets and standards, advice on strategies, and access to technology and innovation coupled with appropriate financing packages. Promote tools, such as value chain analysis, which enable entrepreneurs to see what problems and challenges they need to address within and beyond their own borders and what kind of partners they need to help them.\nPromote policy coherence at regional, national and international level. Work to support whole of government approaches so that trade and investment policies and standard setting are aligned with development co-operation objectives and policies. Support completion of the Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations, including a reduction of barriers to trade in manufacturing and agricultural sectors with major benefits and opportunities for developing countries.\nMaximise the spillover of management skills and knowledge from multi-national enterprises to local SMEs. Spillovers of knowledge and management skills to local firms are one of most critical benefits of foreign direct investment for host countries. Support policy frameworks and multi-national enterprise behaviour that facilitate such spillovers and better document real-world cases to increase public understanding of the contribution of foreign direct investment in progression of development.",

      "Document Title": "Research capacity building in Africa  as part of international programmes : Experience gained from the  Kaapvaal Craton Project",
      "Key Findings": "1. Involvement of black female students in the Kaapvaal Craton programme was low (11%). This is an artefact of the trend in the 1990s when few black females elected to study in the sciences: Analysis of the registration statistics of UCT\nfor the period 1998 to 2001 shows that only 22% of undergraduate students in the Science Faculty were black females, and that this number drops to less than 10% at the post-graduate level (UCT, 2003).\n2. Currently in South Africa there are many government initiatives to raise awareness of science as a viable and exciting career option for women, and this particular problem might improve in future as more female learners get involved in tertiary science training. \n3. Close mentorship proved to be a crucial element between success or failure, especially for students from rural areas. If a student's home environment and culture cannot provide the contextual support for, nor offer informed advice about how to deal with, the highly specialized environment of academic research, it is imperative that for research institution to bridge the gap. Failure to do so increases the risk of the student dropping out to effectively 100%. [It should be noted, however, that good mentorship does not necessarily ensure a close to 100% chance of success.]\n4. In the end there was little undergraduate interaction with the research. Most of the field seasons happened in the southern hemisphere term time, to accommodate the timetable of the overseas scientists, thus making it impossible for interested undergraduates to join the field teams. \n",
      "Key Recommendations": "Close mentorship and contextual support and informed advice on dealing with a specialized environment of academic research will ensure success to the students. It is recommended that careful planning is necessary for a more robust and overt strategy to make sure that (a) the need for activities such as field visits, undergraduate interaction with the research are better understood and  (b) enough time for the necessary activities are more actively included in budgets. \n",

      "Key Findings": "Twenty-five years of investments in agroforestry research clearly demonstrates the potential in many parts of the country and some practices have been widely adopted. But the vast potential remains underexploited, and many technologies have not been widely adopted. Methods to value and assess the social, cultural and economic benefits of various tangible and non-tangible benefits of agroforestry are not available, and the socioeconomic processes involved in the success and failure of agroforestry have not been investigated. \n\nIndia's efforts in agroforestry research have largely been self-supported. Although some international support has been received at various stages, they do not constitute a significant contribution to the overall agroforestry research enterprise in the country. \n\nA major shortcoming is the apparent lack of clear goals, objectives, and political commitment to agroforestry. Agroforestry is perhaps somewhere at the bottom ebb of research priorities even in agricultural and forestry sectors. A more coordinated, focused, determined effort will, undoubtedly, provide more and better results.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "Out of this study, one thing remains clear: enabling policies and supportive political will at the highest levels of government are essential for the success of agroforestry. The analysis also shows that new paradigms such as farmers’ initiatives on tree planting on farms will bring to surface new problems; socioeconomic and policy research will need to be geared to address such new challenges.",

      "Document Title": "Facilitating Research Utilisation: A cross-sector review of research evidence",
      "Key Findings": "Critical  analysis  of  the  findings  from  this  cross-sector  literature  review,  suggests  that  there  are  a  number  of  barriers  to  research  use  that  are  common  to  managers  in  both  the  private  and  public  sectors:  access  to  research;  the  relevance  of  research;  organizational  settings, and the gap between research and practice.  Access  to  research,  and  the  problems  associated  with  gaining  easy  access  to  relevant  research findings was identified as a barrier in education, health and the business sector. Authors  have  frequently  recommended  that  research  findings  should  be  more  accessible  but  for  ideas  to  be  accessible  researchers  may  need  to  “market  their  knowledge”  to  the  practitioner  community  “as  well  as  the  research  community”  (Hemsley-Brown  and Sharp, 2003).     Criticism of the relevance of research was a key factor which emerged from cross sector reviews, and was perceived to be a barrier to research use by managers in both the public sector  (healthcare  and  education)  and  in  the  business  sector.    However,  criticism  of  ‘relevance’  and  ‘access’  are  too  complex  to  address  in  this  paper.    There  has  been  considerable  debate  about the purpose  and  scope  of  management  research,  which  broadly  revolve  around  its  fragmentation  and  its  applied  nature  (Tranfield  and  Starkey,  1998).  A number of studies in the use of research in education and healthcare, concluded that networks to increase communication between researchers and users was an effective approach to facilitating research use. An empirical study of good practices in research use by managers in education conducted in the UK found that there was significant networking and sharing of expertise and a number of successful projects were based on encouraging the sharing of information. The authors recommended strategies for building a critical mass of managers who had experience of using research.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Research use can be facilitated through support and training, collaboration and partnership, strong dissemination strategies, networks, and strong, visible leadership. It is critical that leaders create and develop an organizational culture that values learning and the insight that research provides.",

We review the positive features and weaknesses of various approaches to capacity building, emphasizing that complementary approaches to human resource development work best in the context of a systems and long-term perspective.

      "Key Recommendations": "Developing countries that explicitly commit to strengthening their national health research systems should also invest adequately to ensure that human resources are developed, infrastructure is put in place and the research environment is strengthened.\n\nIn addition, national health research systems, and institutions within these systems, should ensure that a certain proportion of research and development funds from external agencies are committed to national or local plans to develop the competencies and number of researchers.\n\nAt the regional or global level, part of this analysis should document and analyze successes and lessons learned from countries and organizations that have devised innovative financing schemes for health research.",

      "Key Findings": "The history of the agricultural research Networks in WCA shows a strong record of major, sustained investment and support by USAID that is widely recognized and appreciated within the region. The Networks have amply demonstrated their importance and value to regional, collaborative agricultural research in WCA, making them well positioned to contribute significantly to IEHA. It is difficult to fully and accurately assess Network impact, due to insufficient data, and this poses a problem for the Networks as they seek to make the case for increased financial support. The full and active involvement in the research process by farmers (the primary client and targeted end‐user) has shown its great value in helping ensure that research specifically addresses and focuses on farmers’ needs and constraints (demand‐driven, not supply‐driven research), thereby resulting in higher rates of adoption of new varieties and other technologies truly suited to the specific circumstances of farmers. There continues to be a widespread lack of good Internet connectivity throughout much of WCA, a situation which impedes the ability of Network scientists to communicate with each other and the rest of the agricultural research and development (R&D) community.",
      "Key Recommendations": "WARP and its key partners should carefully review the remarkable history and achievements of agricultural research Networks in WCA, with a view to making their decisions regarding the future of the Networks within the larger historical context and longer term development goals and vision of the region. The current investors (NARS, IARCs, USAID, CORAF) should continue, if not increase, their support for these Networks by making a reasonably long‐term funding commitment, subject to the Networks’ continued evolution in response to changing needs of farmers and the cereal sector, increased impact, and periodic review and assessment. The Networks should work together and in conjunction with the NARS to develop systems to collect and analyze the necessary data to better quantify the socioeconomic impact of Network activities at the farm level. The Networks should much more strongly encourage and promote the application and use of farmer‐participatory methods in all future Network research programs, with the expectation of spillover of these approaches into national research programs. USAID, CORAF, FARA, and other interested partners should undertake, with a sense of urgency, a study on the technical and economic feasibility of establishing and maintaining satellite linkages to allow vastly improved Internet connectivity for key research stations and groups throughout the region.",

However, it is apparent that the CUT is still faced with challenges in sustaining accredited research outputs.",

To maintain the upward trend of research output however, the human resources, infrastructure and support should increase concomitantly. The issues that the Office for Research and Development should thus contemplate are the following: (i) is there an `ideal' benchmark in terms of research output for an institution with the size and capacity of the CUT and should such a benchmark be\naligned with the DoE requirement? (ii) should the increase of research outputs continue indefinitely towards alignment with regional needs articulated by commerce, industry and the wider community? and (iii) what would the strategies required to support either of these principles entail?",

      "Document Title": "Russian Civil Society Support Program  Mid-Program Evaluation",
      "Key Findings": "In its first two years, the Russian Civil Society Support Project “Dialogue” has made significant contributions to grass-roots and community-based activists’ efforts to form associations capable of\nlobbying local and regional governments for more responsive social policy. Over 30 local and regional NGO associations and advocacy groups, with a total of 840 constituent organizations, have\nbeen created to represent citizen interests in the areas of health care, education, women’s rights, environmental protection, housing, government transparency, and rights of people with disabilities. With CSSP support, advocacy NGOs across the country have commissioned 20 practical research\nstudies to provide evidence for informed and professional policy making at the municipal and regional level. Exploiting the inadequacy of government structures to address urgent policy needs, CSSP advocacy funding has allowed grantees to conduct over 363 advocacy campaigns addressing 93 distinct legislative and normative acts at the local, regional, and federal levels.\n\nDespite the notable successes, CSSP has suffered its share of confusion and re-structuring due to both internal and external events.\n\nUnlike the first year of CSSP, investment in social policy development in the second year of the program provided a great deal of information regarding both the potential for evidence-based advocacy as well how best to structure it into the larger CSSP design.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Target all of its effort and funding into building the capacities of the thematic alliance grantees. Social policy research and advocacy are not ends in and of themselves, but rather resources and methods used by activists to achieve their ends. By subordinating social policy and advocacy to the goal of association building, CSSP has a greater chance of empowering sustainable structures for on-going advocacy.\nBe more directive in choosing alliance grantees. Independent selection committees can well vet alliance applications for need and policy relevance. CSSP should use its internal expertise to identify those alliance applicants with the greatest understanding of democratic participation and the best laid plans for alliance growth.\nBuild the capacity of thematic alliances to search for and exploit external resources. CSSP should avoid playing intermediary between association, social policy, and working group grantees and hoping for collaboration. Rather, CSSP should use its social policy and advocacy grant funding at the discretion of the thematic alliances so that alliances may choose more relevant grantees and more directly expand their membership bases.\nFocus limited technical assistance funding on individual grantee mentorship programs with a specific CSSP coordinator. With the obligation for Year Three being less than was anticipated, CSSP must more precisely and economically target technical assistance. To date, investment on individualized, not blanket, activities has shown the greatest return in grantee productivity and output.\n",

      "Key Findings": "The Jordan Education Initiative (JEI) has made considerable progress introducing ICT and its use in pedagogy to improve education outcomes. Much more remains to be done in making the educational system adequate for Jordan’s success in a global knowledge economy. The process of ICT innovation is just beginning in Jordan. JEI represents an important instrument for increasing the speed and quality of the innovation process—it has played a critical role in selecting, adapting, and piloting ICT models in Jordanian education.\n\nMuch more attention needs to be paid to the hand off of materials from Discovery Schools to the MoE for national scale up. Outsourcing at least some technical support appears to be effective but requires both technical and management competence in the MoE that will be difficult to develop and maintain.\n\nThe innovations planned for the MoE should stretch but need not greatly exceed its capabilities to manage the innovation process\nJEI-led initiatives in monitoring and evaluation are essential and should be strengthened: increased input from teachers, students, and parents and more systematic and rigorous monitoring and evaluation are needed to accelerate the evaluation of technology models and improvement of content.\n\nThe JEI is likely to face serious challenges as it makes the transition from a high-profile WEF project to an operational NGO with continuing responsibilities for both technology innovation and for assisting public education officials with the scale up of the innovations. The JEI PMO is a small organization with enormous responsibilities to help meet the Kingdom’s objective of building a knowledge economy. At present no other Jordanian organization has the prominence, experience, and capacity to play this role. To achieve its mission the JEI will need continued high-level support, additional capacity, and the continued funding support of the Government of Jordan, private sector partners, and multilateral donors.",
      "Key Recommendations": "The following specific recommendations are recommended concerning scaling up from pilot models in Discovery Schools to full-scale deployment:\n\n1. Solve the most critical information technology management problems using simple, sustainable systems.\n2. Solve the human capacity issue for technical support by expanding the internship program to address weaknesses at the education directorate and central ICT Directorate levels.\n3. Prove these solutions work in Discovery Schools before scaling up.\n4. Develop a model for scaling up successful models and approaches using a strategy that fosters, rewards, and disseminates leadership and innovation at the school level.\n5. Institutionalize the process of improving e-content and innovating in the use of ICT in grades 1–12 in public school education, using the Discovery Schools as a test bed for future improvements and innovations.\n6. Expand public-private partnerships to include employers of knowledge workers.",

Collaboration is critical to enable larger, and better\nfunded, research projects to be successfully undertaken, which may\nalso contribute more substantively to informing health policy within\na country. Another form of increased collaboration, that between\nresearchers and users of research findings, is also required.\n\nConcrete action to promote the retention of skilled and experienced\nresearchers in LMICs. This will require a range of interventions, such\nas improving conditions of service, job security, career pathways,\nopportunities for engagement with peers, etc., many of which again\nrequire a change in the mindset of funders (e.g. to allow the use of\nfunds for salary top-ups and conference attendance).",
      "Key Recommendations": "As most contributors attest in this report, a significant paradigm shift is\nurgently needed in order to align RCS with other health-related changes, and to move health research itself closer towards centre stage at the national level in LMICs. There is an urgent need to move beyond the idea of RCS as primarily related to individual researchers, through the evident institutional capacity challenges, to a more comprehensive, holistic and demand-driven model of national research systems. Such a model genuinely engages policymakers, government officials, the media, health-care professionals, private companies and insurers, patient advocacy groups, community-based organizations, and the general public, as well as the full spectrum of other\nsocial, cultural, civil society and faith-based institutions.",

      "Key Recommendations": "The authors put forward epistemological pluralism as an approach for conducting innovative, collaborative research and study. Epistemological pluralism recognizes that, in any given research context, there may be several valuable ways of knowing, and that accommodating this plurality can lead to more successful integrated study. This approach is particularly useful in the study and management of social–ecological systems. Through resilience theory's adaptive cycle, the authors demonstrate how a focus on epistemological pluralism can facilitate the reorganization of interdisciplinary research and avoid the build-up of significant, but insufficiently integrative, disciplinary-dominated research. Finally,\nusing two case studies—urban ecology and social–ecological research in Alaska—the authors highlight how interdisciplinary work is impeded when divergent epistemologies are not recognized and valued, and that by incorporating a pluralistic framework, these issues can be better explored, resulting in more integrated understanding.",

The paper emphasizes the importance of improving AET systems by strengthening the innovative capabilities of AET organisations and professionals; changing organisational cultures, behaviours, and incentives; and building innovation networks and linkages. \n\n\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "1.Realign visions and mandates:\nAn immediate step towards improving AET systems in sub-Saharan Africa would be to realign the visions and mandates of AET\norganisations with national development aspirations. The goal here is to move the AET system into closer, more productive relationships with other actors within a country’s innovation system, rather than into alignment with what other countries have done previously or with international best practice\n\n2. Develop the human capital base by enhancing innovative capabilities\nIn the medium-term, efforts to improve AET in sub-Saharan\nAfrica should emphasise new interventions designed to further develop the innovative capabilities of the region’s human capital base. Such efforts would focus on the provision of learning opportunities geared to the specific needs of different actors in the innovation system.\n\n3. Facilitate the flow of information and technology:\nEmphasis in the medium-term should also be placed on the development of individual and collective capabilities to access, imitate, and adapt existing information, knowledge, and technology by setting up and supporting more active innovation networks.\n\n4. Induce change in organisational cultures, behaviours, and practices:\nEfforts to induce change in organisational cultures, behaviours, and practices are a longer-term undertaking. Such efforts require recognition by policymakers, public administrators, AET professionals and many other actors that formal AET organisations are not the only ones conducting research and training within an agricultural innovation system, and that linkages with a wide array of other stakeholders can effectively serve both AET organisations and the country’s innovation system\n",

      "Document Title": "Evaluation of the American University in Cairo (AUC) Leadership for Education and Development (LEAD) Scholarship Program",
      "Key Findings": "The major findings are that the LEAD program was successful at increasing access to higher quality education and, further, was extremely successful at targeting young women and students in remote governorates. The program was also found to be extremely successful at recruiting, enrolling, and training students to contribute to communities through development-oriented activities. Leadership training of LEAD was not considered satisfactory. Despite this, many LEAD students are playing leadership roles at the AUC. One student who has shown considerable leadership and overall success is Amira Hassanien. Her story, presented as a case study, is shared throughout the report (See Boxes).\n\nThe program compared favorably from a cost perspective relative to the alternative of sending students overseas for undergraduate studies. Compared to local options (of lower quality), costs are significant and sustainability is not ensured. The AUC is unable to increase their financial participation at this time. While AUC expressed strong interest in the program they are looking to decrease their financial commitment. At the same time, USAID would like to see AUC sharing more, not less, of program costs. There is no plan in place to seek alternative funding. Some program components, such as year abroad, are high cost and criteria for student selection could be tightened. While cost- saving measures come with tradeoffs, the financial uncertainty of LEAD requires that\nsuch steps be carefully considered.",
      "Key Recommendations": " • Further explore the competing philosophies of training and support for LEAD students as they align with the program vision. It may be more appropriate to phase in an approach that aims to orient LEAD to the AUC and community development while\ncelebrating the diversity of students, staff, and especially faculty members, rather than one which devalues their differences.\n• Accommodate a more flexible definition of student contributions in the LPI. This will allow for a more individualized approach to leadership development and would more clearly reward the level of effort in addition to the quantity of activities.\n• Hold lower cost conferences in which LEAD students would be not only attendees, but participants, and would coordinate this nation-wide effort. These students have expressed dissatisfaction with past conferences and suggested that better, more\naffordable conferences be held. LEAD should also consider linking the 2009 conference with other universities.\n• Initiate a newsletter to share information and ideas on various governorates including development projects, styles of dress, and so on, in order to further leverage the potential contributions of a diverse student body.\n• Coordinate an “Egypt Day” between LEAD and the AUC to showcase all the governorates, based on the AUC’s highly-regarded and much-enjoyed international day.",

      "Document Title": "Strengthening capacity for health research in Africa",
      "Key Findings": "In many sub-Saharan African countries there is a nonconducive environment for research: the legislative framework has not kept pace with new trends in research, such as genetics research, ethical conduct of clinical trials, material exchange, and intellectual property rights. These legislative gaps hamper multi-institutional research such as clinical trials. Governments must appreciate the need to make greater commitments to provide strategic planning, legislative reforms, and funding for effective management of research activities. \n\nScience is a global activity, and some of the best African researchers move to countries where their efforts are better rewarded and appreciated. High-profile advocates are needed to promote science within African society, to ensure that research gets its share of the national budgetary allocation and attracts additional external funding. \n\nThe lack of career paths to attract and retain good researchers is the most serious impediment to health research. The development of attractive career pathways is key to bringing research in sub-Saharan Africa to international standards of excellence. Crucial elements frequently missing in African universities are programmes to recruit women into science, promotion of good mentoring, and empowerment of junior scientists. At Makerere University in Uganda, well-funded junior clinical scholarship positions have been put into place to attract, mentor, and retain junior researchers, and a fast-track promotion pathway, based mainly on outstanding research productivity, has been created.\n\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "Nine key requirements were identified for health-research capacity\nstrengthening in Africa, separated into three categories.\n\nImprove the research environment\n• By ensuring a legal framework in which research can flourish\n• By raising the profile of science and health research with policy makers, the media, and local populations\n\nSupport individuals\n• By promoting secondary-school and tertiary-school science education\n• By creating career pathways, developing critical mass, and recruiting and retaining talented scientists\n• By supporting senior scientists to act as research leaders and role models\n\nSupport institutions\n• By developing competitive grant and fellowship schemes administered by African institutions\n• By providing institutional support for infrastructure, management, and technical services, and strategic development planning\n• By promoting networks and partnerships, especially between African institutions\n• By using funding mechanisms as drivers of change at African institutions",

      "Key Findings": "Over the past decade, new dynamics have emerged in each of the key domains of higher education, research and innovation (HERI), which are the integrated base for the Forum’s activities.\nIn higher education, these include: (i) demand; (ii) diversification of provision; (iii) changing lifelong learning needs; and (iv) growing Communication and Information Technology (CIT) usage and enhanced networking and social engagement, both with the economic sector and with the community at large. In scientific research, the tension between basic and applied research is\nthe core issue, thus linking to the “think global, act local” challenge. This necessitates more flexibly organized research systems, and pragmatic approaches which promote “Big Science” while also nurturing science which serves society in the widest sense. In the innovation field, the dynamic\ncomprises both “research for innovation” and “research on innovation”.  Partnerships amongst governments, the economic sector and research universities are growing exponentially, so that new knowledge becomes linked to development goals. But innovation often occurs outside academic environments, as a result of inventive thinking and creative experimentation. Indeed, research system experts must understand the critical factors involved in order to advance this process.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "Understanding the specific socio-political, economic and cultural dimensions of the research\ncontext: this is the essential framework for formulating advice. The examples cited have\nshown that contexts vary greatly and that the forces shaping research have changed radically\nover the past decade.\nDocumenting research systems, whether national or greater in scope, via the collection of reliable data: this is a necessary base for action of improvement. Statistics and trends related to policies, infrastructure, human capacity (HC) and investment must be the basis of evidence based policy-making, certainly that intended to advance a country’s global competitiveness and connectedness and to address local challenges effectively. For developing countries the research dimension of the MDGs should be more clearly articulated, since only this can underpin\nlong-term sustained solutions. This type of research is increasingly prevalent and can inform policy-making in useful ways.\nNurturing research universities is perhaps the single strongest component of knowledge based\nsystems, due to their crucial social, economic and cultural impact. Though well recognized in most countries, inadequate policies and investment over a lengthy period has\ndiminished this potential in the poorest states. Consequently, forward-looking strategies and\na range of partnerships are now urgent in order to bridge the gap. \n",

      "Key Findings": "Evidence of Impact - Cost Share Contributions, and Generated Leveraged Funding \nWhen reviewing the outcomes, results, and impacts of institution-to-institution partnership work, two important indicators of impact and sustainability are often evident when extended financial value is generated. For these 13 partnerships, cost-share from the participating partnerships was nearly 200 percent or rather for every dollar of award, participating institutions contributed two more dollars in cost-share frequently described as faculty time, space, equipment, library, donations of materials, supplies, reference materials, tuition, travel, and computer services.\nEvidence of Impact - Human Capacity Building: \nHuman capacity building is a primary goal of USAID higher education foreign assistance and a major focus of HED’s partnership program. These 13 partnerships demonstrated evidence of knowledge and training for faculty, students, and local citizens—at both the degree and non-degree levels—in host country institutions, at U.S. universities, and in neighboring countries through formal course work, exchanges, internships, and the training of trainers.\nEvidence of Impact - Institutional Capacity Strengthening: \nBoth USAID and HED focus on institutional strengthening as part of the higher education partnership effort. Respondents described examples of new teaching methods they had learned as a result of their classes and visits to U.S. universities such as train-the-trainer methods, active learning, and participatory, interactive teaching-learning techniques, increased used of the Internet, and community service learning.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "Looking ahead, partners reported that they would focus more on detailed and on-going communications among participants including the use of low-cost mechanisms such as virtual networks, conference calls, webinars, and video conferences, as well as experiment with creative teaching methods and new ways to disseminate information. Several partnerships demonstrated that short-term training and the training of trainers can bring about major changes that can facilitate the scaling-up of innovative community college systems, community service learning programs, and local and regional training of doctors to enable reaching large numbers at relatively low cost. \n\nNearly all partners reported the value of attending and participating in the annual HED Synergy Conferences, citing important paybacks, particularly when host country participants present working papers as a way to exchange learning. \nFuture partnership programs must allow sufficient time for planning travel and visa processing for study in the United States, especially given new Homeland Security restrictions on students and academics entering the United States.  \n",

If this trend is to continue, IPRs are likely to play a key role in determining access to these technologies. \n\nWhile the CGIAR´s experience may provide useful lessons, the possibility of establishing a similar network of institutions for the coordinated development and broad diffusion, as public goods, of climate change adaptation and mitigation technologies, poses a large number of political, strategic, and managerial challenges.",
      "Key Recommendations": "In an international scenario dominated by the private development and\nappropriation of technologies, developed countries should make a major concession at the UN Climate Change Convention (COP-15) in Copenhagen to ensure sufficient funding to develop clean technologies and make them globally accessible. If this (certainly ambitious) objective were achieved, a set of research institutions of excellence would be a useful mechanism to undertake a common program of activities.\n\nA mechanism of monitoring and evaluation would be essential to define priorities, to ensure an efficient utilization of resources, and to achieve the concrete results that are urgently needed.\n",

      "Document Title": "Barriers And Facilitators To Research Utilization As Perceived By Business Educators in Tertiary Institutions in Nigeria",
      "Key Findings": "The Business educators reported Lack of time, staff, access to research information, and research knowledge, Lack of support to change existing practice, Lack of knowledge of research terminology, Inability to understand how to apply findings to practice, Inaccessibility of research finding, lack of knowledgeable colleagues and inadequate facilities for implementation as the major barriers to research utilization. These barriers have often been reported in previous BARRIERS studies. One positive finding in the present study is that business educators did not report lack of authority to change practice as a major barrier. This finding is in contrast with what has been found in other studies.\n\nThe Business educators suggested the facilitators as follows: Support and attitude, like devoted and enthusiastic managers were likely to produce a positive attitude toward research utilization, Closer ties between academic and service institutions where educators were encouraged to focus more on teaching their students about research utilization, rather than concentrating on teaching them how to conduct research, An educational background with research courses was also found to be indicative of research utilization, Research results will be enhanced if users made contributions to the research process, such as data collection, Knowledge of the research process, and Administrative commitment and support as major facilitators to research utilization.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "The goal of all research dissemination should be utilization. Utilization may mean different things to different members of a target audience. In some cases, it may mean rejection of a research finding. The critical element of utilization is that the research outcome must be critically and thoroughly digested, and the individual (or organization) must fit the new information with his or her prior understanding and experience. \n\nOne of the most effective ways to increase utilization and to improve the quality and relevance of research is to involve potential users in planning and implementation of the research design itself. \nA great proportion of Business educators perceived several barriers to research utilization. The barriers mainly concerned the characteristics of the organization and the presentation and accessibility of research findings. The business educators also reported the lack of knowledgeable colleagues as a major barrier. To enhance research use, strategies should focus on organizational issues, including supportive leadership and collaboration between colleagues.\n",

      "Document Title": "Research Evidence Utilization in Policy Development by Child Welfare Administrators",
      "Key Findings": "The CAS administrators had fairly consistent perceptions about child welfare evidence. Participants initially described evidence as being synonymous with empirical research findings. However, with some additional probing, this was broadened to include other sources of evidence. \n\nGenerally, the findings support that EBP is recognized among decision makers as a necessary and important shift in how business is conducted. A particularly powerful finding from this study is the emergence that the push for EBP is being driven in large part by individuals who hold leadership positions and who have the power to influence change and create EBP cultures within their local organizations.\n\nOne of the key findings of this study was the identification of external environmental influences at the level of the provincial government as perhaps the singly most important factor on whether evidence-based child welfare practice ever comes to fruition.\n\nParticipants clearly articulated however that while they perceived EBP as beginning to “take hold,” that many changes to the system would be necessary before significant shifts could be realized. \n\nThe notion of working from a reactive, crisis-driven environment needs to be replaced with an environment that is proactive and solution based. This will be a significant challenge for the child welfare field where policy can be driven by the social agendas of the political parties in power and by reactions to child morbidity and mortality events highlighted by the media. \n\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "Four important issues must be addressed to make significant changes in EBP in child welfare. \n\nFirst, the child welfare funders (government) must develop a process to demonstrate that research evidence is being used either instrumentally or conceptually. \n\nSecond, the policy development process needs to be transparent to decision makers and practitioners at the local child welfare agency level. Furthermore, the involvement of agency decision makers in the process in a meaningful way will promote ownership of the policy at the local level, as well as promote greater buy-in than when a closed-door approach is used. \n\nThird, the resource implications at the local level must be considered and action taken to ensure that adequate resources are provided to the local agencies to implement EBP processes. \n\nFourth, organizational factors, such as leadership and an internal champion, were seen as critical to providing a professional role model and access to in-house research resources. It has been reported that an intermediary person is important in gaining momentum and maintaining EBP in the long run asserts that organizational change that includes the adoption of EBP will occur only if agency leadership is supportive of the initiative.\n",

      "Key Findings": "The advantage of randomization over other matching strategies arises from the possible presence of time-varying, unobservable determinants of program participation which are correlated with the outcomes of interest. The author recognizes several challenges in promulgation, acceptance, and use of these reporting standards for randomized intervention evaluations. This paper is intended to promote discussion on raising the quality of RCTs in the development arena by borrowing and building upon the experience from initiatives that aimed at raising the quality of clinical trials through better and complete reporting. One possible concern would be space limitations. Many journals have required page limits toward shorter rather than longer articles. The CEDE checklist is only a suggested set of guidelines which should be considered a work in progress.",
      "Key Recommendations": "In light of these, we would recommend using the journal website where data and codes already stored to be the venue. Alternatively,\nfull study details may be recorded on a project websit e (referred to in the paper), or the website of a relevant international organization, including 3ie .\nIt should be reiterated that the CEDE checklist is only a suggested set of guidelines which should be considered a work in progress. It is likely that improvements will be necessary; moreover, adaptations may be needed to refine the standards for specific fields of intervention research, and additional specifications for specific types of randomized evaluations.\n",

      "Document Title": "A Sociology of International Research Partnerships for Sustainable Development",
      "Key Findings": "The parameters and rules of development research tend to reflect the epistemological traditions of science at ‘Western’ universities of the global North. They are contingent upon the changing nature of the global political economy of knowledge that largely controls the type of knowledge that is generated, the extent of autonomy of knowledge production and the way knowledge is delivered.\n\nIn recent years, the partnership concept has shaped not only international development assistance, but also the organisation of development research. Research partnerships have become instruments that structure knowledge production processes in the context of a globalised research market.\n\nBoth the globalised research market and the allocation of resources of its political economy have implications for what is being studied in development research. Moreover, they urge the research institutions to position themselves in order to survive and flourish in this international and increasingly competitive academic field.\n\nThe production and spread of knowledge depend on national systems of research and innovation and the political will to invest in science. \nThe very positive aspects of the partnership concept are intrinsically linked with the need for negotiating social relations, finding solutions to emerging conflicts and searching for common ground.\n\nWithin international research partnerships, inequalities, structural constraints and historically loaded power relations are felt directly in everyday social and working relations. This is particularly challenging for the field of development research, which seeks to overcome these inequalities.\n\nThe role of universities in fighting inequality is fragile because of its dependence on the politics that determine financial support and, frequently, the field of action.\n\nThe responsibility for financial accountability implies both the power of and the obligation for decision making. This expresses one of the inherent tensions and ambiguities in the concept of research partnerships. Shaping conditions and negotiating social relations for research partnerships is thus not the same for partners from the North and the South. Overcoming this largely structural inequality with regard to access to funding requires time, mutual respect and learning, as well as trust.\n\nResearch partnership arrangements have indeed contributed to the capacity development and empowerment of participating researchers. The collaborating partners generally benefit professionally as well as personally from international exchange and different work cultures\n\nCapacity development is not only individual, targeted at young researchers only, but is also institutional. Partnership arrangements are often not only conducted for research purposes, but also to strengthen a team.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "Longer partnerships provide opportunities to learn from each other. Negotiating social relations in research partnerships can further the acceptance of pluralist views and objectives, aspirations and time concepts. This requires being open to different values and identities. \n\nIncreasing equity in research partnerships requires a critical reflection on the organisation of knowledge produced in development research. This involves an examination of forms of collaboration between development researchers and institutions competing in an increasingly globalised research market.",

The overview of reviews was instructive in showing which health financing topics have had comparatively little written\nabout them, despite being identified as important by key informants. The questions ranked as most important at the consultative workshop were:\n1. How do we develop and implement universal financial protection?\n2. What are the pros and cons of the different ways of identifying the poor?\n3. To what extent do health benefits reach the poor?\n4. What are the pros and cons of implementing demand-side subsidies?\n5. What is the cost-effectiveness of service delivery models and health systems strategies?\n\nThis study has demonstrated that despite the considerable\ndifferences between countries in terms of the nature of health\nfinancing challenges, there is considerable consensus around the\ntype of policy problems faced and the nature of evidence needs.\nImproved evidence e particularly around universal financial\nprotection, ways of identifying the poor, ways of extending benefits\nto the poor and demand-side financing is urgently needed.\n\nFocusing investment and activity on a few critical research questions could serve to develop more rapidly a body of generalizable knowledge that can be applied in the policy process.",

And this has contributed to positive outcomes as measured by the achievement of PDO outcome indicators and the high estimated benefit-cost ratio for the project of 6.2. \n\nAn impressive array of new technologies and practices has been developed by NARO, with many in collaboration with other partners. With the far-reaching reforms enacted through the NARO Act 2005, with its decentralized research institutes and substantially strengthened arrangements for stakeholder participation and oversight to ensure research is more demand driven and relevant to the needs of farmers in their local agro-ecological and economic circumstances, NARO is recognized as one of the leading agricultural R&D institutions in the East African region. \nDuring ARTP II NARO also contributed to the global knowledge pool. Available records indicate NARO scientists generated 116 publications, 52% of which were international refereed journals. A number of studies including the end of project evaluation depicted various levels of outcomes and impacts of investments in research.\n Among the non-starchy staples, mosaic resistant cassava varieties averted famine in northern and eastern Uganda; saving the national economy an estimated US$ 60 million per annum. \n\nAgronomic practices for seed-potato and ware-potato provides the technology backbone of value chain that links 60 farmers to a multi-national food chain (NANDOS). A number of bean varieties were generated to address different agro-ecologies and market preferences. \n\n\n\n\n",

      "Key Findings": "According to the Overseas Development Institute, the factors that define courses of action fall into three overlapping areas: (i) the\npolitical context, (ii) the evidence, and (iii) the links between policy and research communities, within a fourth set of factors: external influences.  It suggests that research-based and other forms of evidence is more likely to enrich policy and thence (hopefully) practice if:\n\n1. It fits within the political and institutional limits and pressures of policy makers, and resonates with their assumptions, or sufficient pressure is exerted to challenge them.\n2. The evidence is credible and convincing, provides practical solutions to pressing policy problems, and is packaged to attract the interest of policy makers.\n3. Researchers and policy makers share common networks, trust one another, and communicate effectively.\n\nIn brief, by making more informed, strategic choices, researchers can maximize the chances that evidence will impact policy and practice.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "Define a clear, overarching policy objective. Influencing objectives need not be limited to facilitating\nchanges in the written content of government policies. The agenda may also include discursive, procedural,\nattitudinal, and behavioral changes.\n• Map the policy context. Mapping the policy context around the issue means identifying key factors that may\ninfluence the policy process.\nIdentify the key stakeholders. Identifying the key influential stakeholders and target audiences involves\ndetermining what are their positions and interests in relation to the policy objective. \n• Identify desired behavioral changes. Developing a theory of change entails describing precisely the\ncurrent behavior and the behavior that is needed, if the key influential stakeholders are to contribute to the\nachievement of the desired policy objective. \n• Develop a strategy. Developing a strategy entails spelling out milestone changes in the policy change\nprocess. Force field analysis is a flexible tool that can be used to further understand the forces supporting\nand opposing the desired policy change and suggest concrete responses.\n• Analyze internal capacity to effect change. To operationalize a strategy, one must ensure the engagement\nteam has the competencies required. In other words, the team must have the set of systems, processes, and\nskills that can help inform or involve policy makers in research. \n• Establish a monitoring and learning framework. The final step is to develop a monitoring and learning\nsystem not only to track progress, make necessary adjustments, and assess the effectiveness of the approach,\nbut also to learn lessons for the future..\n",

      "Key Findings": "• How will a private sector partnership help you implement the Global\n\nHealth Initiative? Remember that partnerships are not an end in them-\nselves, but rather a means to achieve your health objectives – more ef-\nfectively, more efficiently or more sustainably. Design the partnership to meet your needs; don’t sacrifice your core requirements to meet the\nneeds of your partner.\n• Focus on partnerships with the potential for scale and longevity. Even\nsmall partnerships can be time-consuming to create, so make sure that the benefits are worth the effort involved. But also keep in mind that large-scale partnerships may often need to start small to give partners time to learn how to work with each other.\n\n• Look for partners with unique value added (e.g., niche expertise, intellectual property, distribution networks, economies of scale). Focus on private sector partnerships with transformative capabilities that would otherwise not be available to your health program. If you can obtain similar services through an existing procurement, then building a partnership may not be worth it.\n\n• Focus on catalytic opportunities that can become self-sustaining. Identify activities that have the potential to continue in the absence of ongoing USAID funding. Many of the very best partnerships are catalytic: USAID helps initiate the activity, but the private partner maintains it at their own expense because of the value it provides.\n\n• Try to understand the business challenges and opportunities your partner faces. Why do they want to partner with USAID to achieve a health objective? What problems would a partnership help them solve?\n\n\n• Make sure a prospective health alliance will not position a company to take unfair advantage of consumers by imposing monopoly conditions, such as higher prices or fewer choices, in the long run.\n• Engage the Ministry of Health during initial discussions or during the\nearly design phase. They may be able to make critical contributions to the partnership and they may be in a position to help replicate the partnership in non-USAID regions of the country.\n\n• Make sure the partnership has support from senior leadership in your\nMission, your private partner and the MOH. The success of an alliance often depends on the enthusiasm and dedication of certain key individuals.\n• Develop an M&E plan during the design phase of the alliance. Indicators should include traditional health outcomes as well as intermediate outputs that more directly reflect the activities of the partnership. Consult with your private partner to ensure that their data measurement needs are also being met.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Below are some ways to start building a successful alliance.\nMEET WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR\n\nPresent at an open meeting or forum. Work with local chambers of commerce, trade associations, health providers from the public and private sectors or similar organizations to organize an event or offer to speak at an event that’s already been scheduled. In your remarks, highlight your Mission’s goals and programs, USAID’s experience with the private sector, and the ways the private sector benefits from partnering with USAID.\n\nEMBED NEW PARTNERSHIPS IN EXISTING PROGRAMS\nConsider how a partnership could contribute to the success of your core programs by expanding their scope or adding unique resources that would deepen their impact. This approach allows potential partners to easily see how their resources will make a difference.\n\nINCLUDE ALLIANCE ACTIVITIES IN SOLICITATIONS\nAs you design requests for proposals and other solicitations, include alliance activities that complement your key objectives. Implementing partners are often great alliance resources, both for identifying partners as well as managing partnership implementation. The General Counsel’s office has developed specific language for including alliance building in RFPs and RFAs, which is available on the ODP/PSA website.\n\nCONTACT THE TEAM\n\nThe staff of the ODP/PSA office in Washington can provide advice and guidance on navigating the most common alliance challenges, including procurement, due diligence, relationship management and reporting. Your Regional Alliance Builder, who is another extremely helpful resource, is available to assist with initial brainstorming and partnership development activities, as well as solving complex questions. Visit the ODP/PSA website for PowerPoint presentations and other resources, and download ODP/PSA’s “Tools for Alliance \nBuilders” for the nuts and bolts of building a successful alliance.\n\nCONTACT THE GLOBAL HEALTH BUREAU\nAlliance builders in GH can provide advice on building specific types of health alliances and can connect you to staff in other Missions and other agencies with experience in your particular area of interest. Start by contacting your country team lead.",

      "Key Findings": "Instead of starting with basic research, which later becomes a resource for applied research and policy developments, it is important to look at the specific challenges, such as climate change, globalization of food chains and markets, and at society where the needs are and where decisions are being made. The policy level feeds back to science, and primary stakeholders define and articulate their preferences and perceived needs.\n\nThe Sustainable Livelihoods Approach (SLA) holds the potential to accommodate questions like adaptation and mitigation of local climate change, livelihood changes following communities, linkages to global food chains, or development of alternative energy systems.",
      "Key Recommendations": "In order for scientific information and research findings to be relevant and useful to policymakers and farmers, researchers have to make them accessible in an understandable, trustworthy, and suitable form. \n\t\nThe authors argue that a downstream linear science model may be less applicable in the case of research on what we call the new challenges. New challenges such as global climate change, globalization of food chains and markets, and changing energy systems differ from some of our earlier challenges. They are characterized by a high degree of scientific uncertainty and there are intense political differences and conflicts of interest influencing perception of the new challenges and therefore also influencing views on policy options. Whether or not a particular response to climate change is desirable, whether the benefits following globalization of our food chains exceed the potential losses of local livelihoods, and whether one type of energy system meets societal needs more effectively than others cannot be resolved by scientists alone. These challenges must also be handled through political processes. The policy level feeds back to science, and primary stakeholders define and articulate their preferences and perceived needs.\n\nThe SLA may currently be the best framework available to individual researchers and organizations involved in R4D due to its people-centered approach, where the scientific knowledge pool is drawn upon after the research questions have been formulated in cooperation with relevant stakeholders. \n\nFinally, while the assumption in the linear model is for research to influence policy, policy also influences research.\n\n",

      "Key Findings": "Product Development Projects (PDP)s are playing a major role as managers of R&D funding for neglected diseases, while the portfolio approach of effective PDPs both protects product development and reduces funding risk. PDP costs are rising rapidly as products move closer to patients and this is concerning. The extremely small number of funders in PDP investment is putting strain on the progress of PDP portfolios.\nMost public funding for PDPs comes from national aid agencies, whose\nrole is to support the developing world, yet 87.8% of PDP R&D funds are re-invested directly back into Western, and often national, academic institutions, contractors and pharmaceutical firms. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "The analysis demonstrates that PDPs are playing an increasingly major role as managers of R&D funding for neglected diseases, while the portfolio approach of effective PDPs both protects product development and reduces funding risk. This analysis suggests that funding for effective PDPs should be preferentially protected in difficult times, unlike those happy periods where funding is unconstrained and the appetite for risk is higher.\n\nFinally, urgent measures need to be taken to support effective PDPs in their increasingly important role as creators, developers and deliverers of new products for neglected diseases. In this context, it is worth noting that most public funding for PDPs comes from national aid agencies, whose role it is to support the developing world, yet 87.8% of PDP R&D funds are re-invested directly back into Western, and often national, academic institutions, contractors and pharmaceutical firms.",

      "Document Title": "Institutionalism of Government Evaluation: Balancing Trade-Offs",
      "Key Findings": "In terms of the inception of an institutionalized system for evaluation, three common factors stand out from the cases discussed in this paper. Firstly, the existence of a democratic system with a vibrant and vocal opposition appears to have been an important enabling\nfactor, as has the existence of influential M&E champions to lead the process. Furthermore, a clear powerful stakeholder, such as Congress, the Ministry of Finance, or the Presidency facilitates triggering the process. In addition, technical assistance and the existence or training of technical capacity in the country have been important enabling\nfactors both for the inception and sustainability of the systems.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Overall, we want a system that is independent in order to achieve external credibility and social legitimacy, but not so independent that it loses its internal relevance. The placement of the system and the powers to publicly disclose the information produced, without a bias towards positive results, are key determinants of independence, credibility and legitimacy. \nIt is important to enjoy a unique and broad legal mandate to ensure enforcement of recommendations, and avoid competing initiatives that undermine consolidation and legitimacy. Legal support from Access to Public Information or Transparency Laws is also an important asset to back full public disclosure, especially in systems located within the executive.\nIn terms of independence, a best practice example is provided by external governing bodies like the academic board of Mexicoâ€™s Coneval.\nIn addition, we want a system that is able to influence policy-making and the adoption of recommendations, either by promoting ownership or by using enforcement powers.\n\nAlso, there needs to be a clear focus on usage and clarity on a client or set of clients that are to be served, and what their interests are. It can be Congress or Parliament, the broader society, central government or program management. \n\nFinally, we want a system that is sustainable over time and transcends governments because it is perceived as responsive to the needs of clients and useful to its main stakeholders. For this, the performance of the systems should begin to be tracked.",

      "Key Findings": "The interaction model is regarded as the main explanatory model. It acknowledges the interactive and incremental nature of policy development, which takes place in a context and includes diversity within the groups of researchers and policymakers. This fits well in the dynamic and complex setting of local Dutch health policy.\n\nFor the conceptual framework we propose a network approach, in which we \"extend\" the interaction model. We not only focus on the one-to-one relation between an individual researcher and policymaker but include interactions between several actors participating in the research and policy process.\n\nIn this model interaction between actors in the research and the policy network is expected to improve research utilization. Interaction can obstruct or promote four clusters of barriers between research and policy: expectations, transfer issues, acceptance, and interpretation. These elements of interactions and barriers provide an actual explanation of research utilization. Research utilization itself can be measured on the individual level of actors and on a policy process level.\n\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "The developed framework has added value on existing analytical frameworks and models like Landry and\nHanney because it emphasizes more on the ‘logic’ of the context and the existing networks within this specific public health policy domain. By ‘logic’ we mean the aims, duties and responsibilities of actors from participating organizations and relations between them in the Dutch context of local health policy.\n\n The proposed conceptual framework is to be used in empirical studies about how epidemiological research progresses within the policymaking process. The primary research question in these studies is whether or not interactions will contribute to the use epidemiological research in local health policy development.\n\nFurther operationalisation of the concepts mentioned in the framework is necessary. Different contextual and key factors have to be transformed into relevant questions for actors about their position in the networks, their relations, their involvement in research, their attitude towards it and their perception and judgment on the way research was transferred\n\n",

      "Key Recommendations": "In order to overcome fragmentation and marginalisation, development research will have to reinvent itself. We argue that this means first and foremost seeking bridges and building synergies between the different actors of development research. This must imply the development of stronger partnership on a global level, above all with related institutions and think tanks in so-called 'developing countries'. Equally important is a dialogue with the so-called 'end users' of research, both in the South and the North, whereby research will become more relevant to the concrete needs of those whom it intends to serve: the poor and marginalised. Moreover, this dialogue should be viewed as a most urgent way of democratising science and research and could find academic support in a cross-disciplinary way of doing development research. At the same time, research for and research on development will have to overcome their differences and build disciplinary bridges. Moreover, we believe that cross-disciplinarity between social and natural sciences is crucial for development research globally, and is required to meet the demands of development practice as well.\n\nA crucial task for development research emerges globally: development research could make a real contribution to changing the global scientific architecture with its inherent discriminatory asymmetries of access and power. Rather than trying to increase the market value of development research on the global science market, development research should question the mechanisms of this market and the agents of change that frame dominant paradigms in development practice of today.

      "Key Findings": "Research trends\n• There is a trend that aid administrations seek evidence and documentation through research – particular to answer the questions of aid effectiveness.\n• The link between aid administrations and research on aid effectiveness is often in the form of partnerships with (inter) national, independent institutions and think tanks (often commissioned work or research initiated by the institution and then financed from aid budgets.\n• One pitfall is the risk of “incrementalism” when research is too closely linked to the aid administration - main reason to keep the research at arms length (and possibly not finance “aid works research”).\n• The communication links between researchers and aid administrators is weak, encumbering the mutual learning process.\n• Indications that organisations focus on building up research communities in the South through assistance to access tools and methodologies (the “wholesale approach”).\n• DFID goes an extra mile in linking research with practice and has instituted a major organisational change, ODI has several initiatives working on these issues.\n\nEvaluation trends\n• Most development agencies have internal evaluation departments with independent status.\n• The UK is now setting up a watchdog function externally to oversee all activities, including commissioning evaluations. This will also report\nParliament on aid effectiveness and strengthen accountability towards the public.\n• All agencies consider evaluations of the portfolio of high importance when it comes to collecting evidence of what works and what does not work. The trend is to apply more scientific methodologies such as impact evaluation methodologies.\n• Impact evaluations are given considerable attention internationally. They are costly and major undertakings, but they dig deep and provide stronger evidence on the attribution of aid. Critics say that they are too expensive and often narrow.\n• The World Bank aims to mainstream impact evaluations in the portfolio as part of a standard monitoring and evaluation procedure, this is also links to the knowledge agenda.\n• Overall the emphasis on methodologies such as impact evaluations shows the trend of a closer link between research and evaluation – the interest is to be able to present robust evidence.\n• Evaluations are “closer” to portfolios than research, but evaluations do not answer the macro questions. One agency strongly advocated for attention to the micro-level in evaluations, because it is the concrete situations that change minds and practice.\n• Dissemination and utilization of evaluation findings continue to be a\nchallenge, however there is a general trend both in theory and practice\ntowards user-oriented evaluations emphasising internal learning.\n\nMonitoring trends\n• The data sets for monitoring are often limited by general data availability and robustness in developing countries; the Paris Declaration principles have magnified this.\n• Aid administrations and think tanks focus on capacity building of statistics and monitoring in developing country institutions\n• Management for results has its limitations in a political environment, in its pure form it requires an organisation with a limited mandate.\n• A drive for results based management and monitoring for results also emphasises internal learning.\n\nCommunication trends\n• There are two lines of communication going on in organisations: Communicating to the external stakeholders about results and development (public diplomacy), and then communicating to internal stakeholders with the purpose of enhancing results and development (learning).\n• All mapped organisations talked about those two functions as intimately tied together – drawing on the same information and to some extent using the same channels.\n• Ways of communicating about results is currently being reformed with the many new channels available (such as social forums online). However, the challenge is to be able to communicate the substantial issues.\n• There is a general lack of confidence in ways of communicating to the ‘wider public’ on substantial topics beyond “hungry children”.\n\n• Development agencies generally feel the knowledge sharing (research-practice evaluations) could be strengthened, and many have introduced procedures and formal arrangements to accommodate this.\n• Knowledge management and knowledge sharing are difficult to formalize knowledge is most effectively shared informally.\n• Synthesising knowledge from research, practice and evaluations to strengthen aid effectiveness bears great wins as well as trade-offs.\n\nOrganisational views\n• A closer relation between research and development practice requires the support of an organisational set-up tailored for the purpose, i.e. generating robust knowledge in research communities, channelling this to practitioners and external stakeholders\n• Focus on results and management for results require major changes in business processes\n• There are trade-off of the organisational closeness between research functions and aid administrations. Closeness gives increase use of research results; distance gives more independence but less use of results.\n• Defining questions to be synthesised on an annual basis and commissioning a study to be written in a user friendly language and then disseminated to practitioners is done by the Danish Evaluation Institute.",

      "Key Findings": "The overall gain and impact of the new approach, which led to greater diffusion of knowledge, technologies, inputs and innovations to increase yields and market access for the small producers, can be expected to grow further in future as farmers currently unreached through this initiative will also become beneficiaries. Recognition of the benefits gained from this approach led to the entire national research system adopting it, and increased demand by the federal government to engage in scaling up available agricultural technologies across the country.\n\nThe successes have been attributed to, among other factors, change in the mindset of researchers, availability of relevant technologies by a better linking of service providers with farmers, emerging market opportunities and the catalytic effect of bringing together major actors along the value chain.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "The case described in this paper points to a number of lessons for similar initiatives on scaling up and putting research into use.\nOften the ingredients for a successful scaling up and/or research-into-use process are within the system, but do not work as a system. Therefore, it is frequently not so much technology failure that inhibits uptake as a failure of the institutions and actors to make the system work as a system. \nA catalytic effect is required to create that coherence and integration and the commitment of the actors to drive the process from inside and make it work.\nThe facilitation of this process is critical and the skills and attitudes to do it successfully are vital for such initiatives.\nDriving such initiatives in the public research sector requires a considerable change of mindset and of the pattern of the typical civil servant mentality. It requires entrepreneurial individuals with a total commitment to success at the farmer’s level which is stronger than institutional rules and mandates. \nA change in mindsets and behavioural patterns can be brought about by confronting people with their own mission and allowing them to experience the discomfort of failing to achieve it – rather than through preaching change or debating highly theoretical innovation system models. \n\nFinally, the right leadership is needed, as are other key ingredients such as markets and technologies – and all are needed at the right time.\nDespite all the effectiveness of competence development, therefore, the same effect in different situations cannot be expected.\n",

      "Document Title": "How should we assess knowledge translation in research organizations; designing a knowledge translation self-assessment tool for research institutes (SATORI)",
      "Key Findings": "The pilot study conducted across 20 TUMS centres and departments showed that while conducting research and producing knowledge are performed with appropriate quality and timeliness in the university, there are significant\nweaknesses in the interactions between researchers and their research target audiences (both in selecting research priorities and transferring the results), securing the financial resources and following supportive regulations for knowledge translation activities. The comparison of the mean scores obtained in different\n domains confirmed that research capacity and knowledge production is acceptable but there are certain weaknesses in the aptitude of the last two domains of knowledge transfer and promoting the use of evidence.\nIn view of the weaknesses identified in our study, the main interventions needed for TUMS include:\n1) Facilitating knowledge translation activities\nthrough provision of financial resources required for\nthese activities;\n2) Facilitating knowledge translation activities\nthrough creating supportive and facilitating infrastructures\nfor these activities;\n3) Facilitating interactions between researchers and\ntarget audiences to exchange questions and research\nfindings.\n\nThe challenges faced by TUMS in knowledge translation issues are somewhat similar to those faced by other countries. Though many investors in developed countries financially support knowledge translation activities, and have established certain structures and regulations to strengthen knowledge translation, the interaction between researchers and target audiences is still a major concern. Most of the interventions proposed to strengthen knowledge translation, even in developed countries, focus on facilitating and enhancing the interaction between researchers and research users.\n\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "The comparison of organizational strengths and weaknesses, based on the scores gained through this questionnaire can help officials define intervention priorities.\nAlthough the establishment of an organizational unit for improving knowledge translation is a costly strategy; it may be beneficial for developing strategies to promote KT, such as designing a guideline for publishing the results, and the development of regulations to support the intellectual rights of the researchers. The following steps can help prioritize KTE interventions: \n(1) preparing a list of the statements which have obtained low scores on the self –assessment test, (2) formulating intervention options, and\n(3) assessing the organizational context and different aspects such as feasibility, cost and chance of success for\neach intervention.\n\nAnd in addition to being used in Iran’s academic environment, we believe it could be applied to other countries’ research organization settings as well. This tool covers the most important activities, necessary resources and facilitating strategies for knowledge translation at the organizational level, and similar to its\nCanadian counterpart, this tool can also be used for re-evaluation of the organization’s promotion in knowledge translation. In addition, discussion and dialogue is possible concerning each statement of the tool that could lead to identification of intervention(s) regarding weaknesses of the organization. Finally, different perspectives could be elaborated upon and considered during the prioritization of interventions, since the discussion group consists of a variety of different stakeholders including members of research councils, research managers, researchers and research users.\n\n",

      "Document Title": "Towards Sustainable Research Capacity Development and Research Ownership for Academic Institutes in Developing Countries: The Malawian Research Support Centre Model",
      "Key Findings": "The objective of the RSC programme was to develop a Malawian-owned RSC that would attract high-quality Malawian researchers from abroad, contribute to capacity building through a comprehensive course programme and on-the-job training opportunities, introduce GCP standards, advance Malawi’s capability to develop its own research agenda, and successfully compete for international research grants.\n\nIn the initial phase, due to unfamiliarity with the RSC concept, recruiting of the core staff from the local academic community was complicated. However, as soon as the RSC became well known in the local research community, the expatriate staff initially recruited could be replaced by scientists from the region. By year two the RSC had a well established staff base and organisational structure. \n\nWith the RSC assuming a coordination role for research in the CoM, the need for a governance framework for its operations became evident. The RSC facilitated the development of a CoM Research Policy, which set the mandate and operational scope of the RSC. The RSC also established research grants management procedures that streamlined grant administration into well defined pre- and post-award processes.\n\nOver the past four years, the CoM has experienced a rapid growth in the number of competitive international grants awarded directly to Malawian investigators. This is attributed partly to the increased visibility of research in the college and the support provided by the RSC, which has motivated academics to become involved in grant writing. The core funding for the Malawian RSC was provided by a four-year NACCAP grant (NWO-NACCAP, 2010). \n",
      "Key Recommendations": " The Malawian issue are comparable to those in many other sub-Saharan African countries. An important reason for the success of the RSC is that the Malawian academic community embraced the RSC concept soon after its start. The comprehensive approach and local ownership of the RSC has appealed to a new generation of African academics, who have a growing awareness that the role of donors and guest universities from the North may need to be revisited. In most African research institutions, major research has traditionally been driven by expatriate researchers who have come as part of capacity strengthening efforts.\n\n This is evident from the few publications in which African researchers are the lead authors. Inevitably the foreign researchers dominate the local research agenda, have more skills and experience to attract international funding, and, as principal investigators, exercise intellectual ownership. An RSC-like initiative may be welcomed by other African Universities with comparable problems.\n\nFurther, the Malawian RSC core staff could play a supportive role in the initial phase of developing similar programs in the region. This has already been accomplished with the recent establishment of RSCs at the University of Zimbabwe College of Health Sciences and the University of Zambia School Of Medicine, based on the Malawian model and supported by Malawian RSC staff. \n\nIt may be time to consider developing an African RSC network in which south training and coaching is a critical component. If successful, this initiative may contribute to true sustainable research capacity building and to local research ownership.\n",

      "Key Findings": "The key findings were as follows: There was a lack of clarity and agreement (pact) about a development model and the role of higher education in development, at both national and university levels. There was, however, an increasing awareness, particularly at government level, of the importance of universities in the global context of the knowledge economy. Research production at the eight African universities was not strong enough to enable them to build on their traditional undergraduate teaching roles and make a sustainable, comprehensive contribution to development via new knowledge production. A number of universities had manageable student–staff ratios and adequately qualified staff, but inadequate funds for staff to engage in research. In addition, the incentive regimes did not support knowledge production. In none of the countries in the sample was there a coordinated effort between government, external stakeholders and the university to systematically strengthen the contribution that the university can make to development. While at each of the universities there were exemplary development projects that connected strongly to external stakeholders and strengthened the academic core, the challenge is how to increase the number of these projects.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "\"For African countries to move from being providers of raw materials and receivers of foreign\naid to the next stages of development that will make them part of the global knowledge\neconomy, implies at least the following. Firstly, agreement (a pact) about the importance\nof knowledge in development and the special role of the university. Secondly, strengthening\nthe academic core, particularly in terms of knowledge production. Thirdly, greater\ncoordination amongst an increasing number of actors and agencies (multiple government\ndepartments, business and foreign donors) involved in higher education. And finally,\nensuring that development activities strengthen rather than weaken academic capacity,\nparticularly for flagship universities.\"\n",

      "Key Findings": "Use of Randomization and Other Experimental and Quasi-experimental Research Designs:  In order to more reliably establish causation, REAP employs randomized interventions to help China’s authorities determine whether policies deliver desirable outcomes. Like a clinical trial in a medical setting, randomized trials involve treatment and control groups that are statistically identical. \n\nPursuit of collaboration: About a dozen researchers and programme staff at Stanford University and their counterparts at CCAP comprise the core team at REAP. This group cooperates to oversee all of REAP’s initiatives and make all strategic decisions.\n\n Pursuing Policy Relevance: We seek to only design interventions that policymakers are likely to take an interest in. If an intervention cannot be adopted or expanded as a broader policy, it is of no practical use outside of an economics journal. REAP takes several steps to ensure that its interventions maintain policy relevance.\n\n Incrementalism:\nAfter exploring opportunities and settling on an area where we can add value, we start small with a relatively limited pilot and an evaluation. After analyzing these results we will move to a larger test of a concept, often incorporating several different approaches. \n\nRobust Outreach: Part of REAP’s strategy for success is to disseminate our findings to as wide an array of audiences as possible in order to generate interest in our work. To ensure “cross border” accessibility, the majority of our outreach materials are available in both English and Chinese. REAP publicity targets three main groups: general audiences, policy makers, and academia.\n\n\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "REAP’s experience in impact evaluation can be distilled into four key recommendations.\nEmphasize Empiricism: There are thousands of government entities, private organizations, and research institutions around the world—and especially in China today—that are dedicated to solving problems for vulnerable populations. Often they are awash with money and good intentions. Yet the problems they are committed to solving persist. REAP believes this is partly because very few organizations are able to convincingly answer a fundamental question about their efforts: Do they work? Quantitative, experimental design is the best means to reliably measure success and effectively channel ideas and investments that target the world’s most pressing problems.\nLeverage Local Expertise:  Rigorous randomized impact evaluation requires the involvement of large numbers of people and intimate knowledge of local circumstances. REAP is a group of economists, some of whom are from non-Chinese institutions. \n\nFocus on the Practical: By incorporating local partners, focusing on policy relevant problems, shedding light on workable solutions, and keeping our messages simple, REAP has been able to not only produce cutting edge research results, but also deliver useful policy solutions to people that need them.\n\nCommunicate Effectively: REAP’s capacity to perform depends on sharing its results and reaching out to groups whose interests align with our capabilities. The only way to discover and leverage these synergies is to disseminate news of our work and results to as wide an audience as possible. An effective policy intervention will do no one any good if nobody knows about it.\n\n",

      "Document Title": "A can of worms? Implications of rigorous impact evaluations for development agencies",
      "Key Findings": "Nowadays, there is increased attention to result measurements in development co-operation. The international child support (ICS) case study shows that rigorous impact evaluations are more than an additional step in the project cycle; impact evaluations influence every step of the program and project design. These programmatic\nchanges, which are needed to make rigorous impact evaluations possible, may go against the strategy and principles of many development agencies. Therefore, impact evaluations not\nonly require additional resources but also present organizations with a dilemma if they are willing to change their approach and programs.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Rigorous impact evaluation is not a gold standard for monitoring and evaluation practices of NGOs. The timelines, demands and requirements of research are not responsive to the immediate and medium term needs of NGOs. Thus there are many reasons for NGOs to rely on other methods. However, impact evaluation is a very valuable methodology that contributes to organizational learning and improves accountability of many programmes. What this paper highlights is that rigorous impact evaluations deliver valuable findings but also require many resources and are difficult to organize for a relatively small NGO. It is questionable if rigorous impact evaluations should be organized by an NGO on its own.  This is because impact evaluations are costly and it is difficult to develop an organization in a way that there is a good balance between programmes and evaluations.\n\nTherefore it is recommended that organizations join forces with likeminded organizations before starting collaborations with universities and knowledge centres. Instead of evaluating the results of an individual programme, more fundamental issues can be jointly evaluated. \n",

      "Key Findings": "Among the factors that facilitated PMTCT policy uptake and continued implementation were: shared platforms for learning and decision making among stakeholders, implementation pilots to assess feasibility of intervention, the emerging of agencies to undertake operations research and the high visibility of policy benefits to child survival. In contrast, SMC policy processes were stalled for over two years after the findings of the Uganda study was made public.\n\nAmong other factors, policy makers demanded additional research to assess implementation feasibility of SMC within ordinary health system context. High level leaders also publicly contested the SMC evidence and the underlying values and messages – a situation that reduced the coalition of policy champions\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "This study shows that effective translation of PMTCT and SMC research results demanded a “360 degree” approach to assembling additional evidence to inform the implementation feasibility for these two HIV prevention interventions. MakCHS and similar institutions should prioritize implementation research to guide the policy processes about the feasibility of implementing new and effective innovations (e.g. PMTCT or SMC) at a large scale in contexts that may be different from the research environments",

In the context of  research–policy partnerships there is great potential for such ‘‘dashboard’’ systems to simultaneously improve research, policy, and\npractice and to strengthen these partnerships at the state level\nby mutually supporting the needs of each stakeholder.",

      "Key Findings": "Perhaps the most immediate contribution of the case study is that the early child- hood research group's increasing visibility and its growing success as measured by research assessment criteria illustrates that, despite substantial structural constraints, in the Australian context in a non-research intensive university, it remains possible to build educational research capacity from a low base to the level of national prominence.\nThe case study has also illuminated influences contributing to the regional University becoming a 'rich pocket ... of research activity' in early childhood education (Leitch, 2009, p. 368): strategic leadership and commitment at multiple levels within the university, seed funding, engagement with government policy priorities, collegiality, collaboration, networks, methodological expertise, enculturation and situated learning.\nImportantly, the case study has also highlighted that it is possible to collectively construct a 'liveable [academic] world'  by strategically meeting the demands of the political economy of research production without being subsumed by them. Constructing a liveable word in the case study site required attending to the affective, relational and ethical dimensions of research capacity building\n",

      "Key Findings": "YPs (Young Professionals) are making significant contributions to agricultural value chains through research, however, there are other fields of development through the value chain that are not (yet) considered. Broader view into the value chain is required so as to influence policy and decision makers. \n\t\nMoreover, investment in capacity building and mentorship programmes in the agricultural value chain can also play an important role in preparing the youth to make a desired transformation in the agriculture sector. The YPs are too often not offered training in skills that can prepare them to engage with the development sector. Interaction among the YPs and with mentors/seniors; and collaboration with other professional networks such as the IWA Young Water Professionals can assist the YPs to make a valuable contribution towards development and transformation of the agricultural sector.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "Any development strategy/policy of the southern African region should include a strong emphasis on the capacity development and transformation of its agricultural sector. These strategies should encourage youth to take advantage of the potential of new technologies to link youth to agriculture and farmers to markets along value chains. \n\nThere is a need for integrated research approach in the agricultural sector. Capacity building needs to go beyond offering research opportunities, that is, there is a need for mentorship and on the job-training programmes as well as technology and skills transfer. It is critical that development initiatives groom students and emerging professionals to contribute meaningfully to research for development. Therefore African universities need to have strong internship programmes that can prepare young people to be stronger participants in the agricultural value chains and agents of change. \n\nDevelopment organisation should create a space for the YPs to interact and exchange ideas and knowledge regarding relevant research, innovations, opportunities and challenges in their fields of research. This would keep them informed on progress made and information available in their respective subjects of research. \n",

      "Document Title": "Final Evaluation: Afghanistan Higher Education Project (HEP)",
      "Key Findings": "First, the PDCs were rated by university leaders as having had the most significant impact, especially the pedagogical training, followed by the Strategic Planning activities.\nThere is a need to extend the pedagogy trainings across all Faculties in the universities and to improve their quality.  Strong leadership at the Chancellor and Vice-Chancellor level is the key to improvements in the quality of education. Six of the eight Chancellors or Vice-Chancellors interviewed were educated abroad. They know and understand strategic planning and are driving their universities based on their strategic plans. \n\nSecondly, documentation has been comprehensive. The MoHE, along with the leadership in institutions of higher education (chancellors and deans), has shown a strong commitment to the process. The development and capacity building process at the MoHE has been\nparticipatory and based on articulated needs of the Ministry and higher education institutions; and the goals as defined by the MoHE or higher education institutions as spelled out in the National Higher Education Strategic Plan.\n\nThird, MoHE staff performance and achievements have improved in the targeted departments. Both management skills and leadership capacity trainings provided to mid management and rank-and-file members were effective.\n\nFinally, the Ministry of Higher Education has made great progress in developing agencies and systems for quality assurance for institutions of higher education. This progress has been supported financially and through strong technical assistance by the WB/SHEP2, and through strong technical assistance from HEP.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "A few key components of HEP are worth continued focused support, in order to continue the best work that has been done. Given the post-conflict reconstruction context of the HEP project, and the need to support leaders at the MoHE and institutions of higher education who are beginning to create Afghan-led change, a top priority for consolidating HEP’s accomplishments would be to document the human capacity built through the project and analyze how it can best be leveraged for the next phase of reconstruction work. This could include: organizational mapping, the drawing together of the Master’s degree graduates through an alumni association, and the incorporation of Key Trainers of Pedagogy and Key Trainers of Leadership into future university faculty training plans.\n\nSmall grants supporting quality and relevance could be offered in several key areas. To support the development of female Afghan education leaders, scholarship or training opportunities could be offered to them, perhaps in neighboring countries such as India. Support for inter-university study visits within Afghanistan, perhaps starting with the Master’s graduates, might foster cohesion and a united sense of purpose for future work\n\nFinally, there are other areas where limited resources might have disproportionate impact in the areas of access, equity, and management/governance. For example, approaches need to be developed to encourage female student participation and an increased number of female faculty members in higher education. The research available on this issue should be gathered and a principled plan developed to encourage and support more female participation. Specific institutions of higher education where the leaders appear to be making efforts in this direction should be rewarded for their initiative with focused resources being offered to support what each institution sees as its greatest needs in this area",

Second, most of the industry variables indicate high demand in the developing countries’\ngovernments and practitioners, as well as GCC states. Finally, all the economy variables present medium potential because most of the programs implemented within less than 10 years.\nAlthough the differences between the developing countries can be concluded: 1) By economy variables such as the number of startup companies and jobs creation can be change from country to other depend on the funded year, for example, in Bahrain program the funded year 2003 and the number of startup companies 35. However, in Saudi Arabia the funded year 2009 and number of startup companies 6. 2) from the perspective Industries variables some\ninnovation programs operated by governments and others operated by the private sectors or technology park, for example, the in Dubai innovation program operated by the government but the Qatar program operated by technology park, and Morocco programs operated by private sectors.",

      "Key Findings": "The project is assessed to have achieved a high level of efficiency. \n\t\nRAZUM Program (EUR 8.03 million): The objective of the RAZUM program was to support the development of knowledge-based SMEs with a potential to have a positive impact on economic development. The program provided loans covering up to 70 percent of new product development costs, with maximum support of EUR 1.5 million per project and duration of up to three years. \n\nCapabilities developed that might influence subsequent R&D productivity: (i) improved\nfirm’s competitiveness internationally; (ii) increased technical capacity to conduct R&D\nextended knowledge; and (iii) increased capability of staff.\n\nExpected benefits derived from commercial application of the R&D results:\n- Increased competitiveness on the international market (60% of firms);\n- Strengthened presence on the targeted markets (65% of firms);\n- Improved knowledge of the markets (75% of firms have good or excellent knowledge);\n- Improved skills for commercialization (15% of firms with excellent skills and 75% of\nfirms with good or medium skills)\n\nChanges in firm behavior that resulted from having received support from RAZUM:\nInnovation ideas were generated: 55 percent of the firms generated new ideas while\nworking on the project, but did not have enough capacity to work on other innovations and to\nengage in additional R&D activities and 35 percent managed to work on additional R&D\nactivities in parallel with the project itself.\nR&D human capacity increase appeared to be sustainable: 80 percent of the firms intend to\nkeep the newly hired staff after the project closure.",
      "Key Recommendations": "A first lesson learned from the Science and Technology Project is that innovation related projects may achieve tangible results within a relative short time. STP achievements indicate that Croatia’s innovation performance was not constrained by a lack of ideas, as sometimes argued, but by the availability of appropriate institutions – such as TTOs, early-stage financing and\nmentoring services. \n\nA lesson potentially valid to several middle income countries, therefore, is that untapped sources of innovation could be unleashed provided that an adequate institutional environment is in place.\n\nA second lesson derives from factors seemingly critical for STP achievement: (i) focus on well defined, quantifiable targets (enabling commercialization of publicly funded research and\nsupporting SME investments in R&D); (ii) design of a comprehensive set of instruments targeting informational and financial bottlenecks inherent to innovation processes (TTOs and\nBICRO programs); (iii) a transparent and meritocratic governance regime of the support programs; and (iv) monitoring schemes put in place in the beginning, allowing the necessary adjustments to materialize. \n\nA third lesson can be learned from what STP could not achieve, namely: restructuring research institutes and promoting a venture capital industry. The failure in fostering restructuring of research organizations was caused by a combination of political and technical difficulties. \n\nWhile a complex political economy is to some extent inherent to any restructuring process, a technical difficulty found in STP was related to definition of the own concept of restructuring, as BI did not count with direct government support and was financially self-sustained.

It has the potential to bring economic benefits to the country. This review explores the roles of the private sector in the development of this particular field and attempts to identify the practical approaches that could leverage private sectors through the experience and success of other innovative developing countries.\n\nThe private sector is the key in the development of health biotechnology. Health innovation systems should be emphasized, and more specific, practical actions must be taken to address the health problems of the poor by leveraging private sector capabilities and resources. We strongly emphasize that to harness the private sector, governmental and international organizations should encourage and facilitate various partnerships between sectors, regions, and countries.",
      "Key Recommendations": "For most developing countries, improvements to the health status\nof the poor and to health care accessibility are critical challenges. To overcome this challenge, developing countries must place science, technology, and innovation at the center of their development strategies.\n\nThe creation of non-linear linkages and interrelations between knowledge generation and enterprise development is another vital challenge faced by developing countries. Governments should encourage close connections between different innovation actors such as universities, research institutions, financial agencies and the private sector by establishing policies, regulations that provide incentives to the sectors, and infrastructure, as well as by improving the financial mechanisms of the country. Priority should be given to strengthening and expanding institutions that create synergies between biomedical researchers, teachers, medical practitioners, and outreach groups. Governments should build an innovation ecosystem sufficient to support private sector development, as it is one of the key resources in economic development human welfare. The government can serve as a vital channel for the delivery of medical services.",

      "Key Findings": "Applying research to guide evidence-based practice is an\nongoing and significant challenge for public health.\nDevelopments in the emerging field of ‘translation’ have\nfocused on different aspects of the problem, resulting in\ncompeting frameworks and terminology. In this paper the\nscope of ‘translation’ in public health is defined, and four\nrelated but conceptually different ‘translation processes’\nthat support evidence-based practice are outlined: (1)\nreviewing the transferability of evidence to new settings,\n(2) translation research, (3) knowledge translation, and\n(4) knowledge translation research. Finally, an integrated\nframework is presented to illustrate the relationship\nbetween these domains, and priority areas for further\ndevelopment and empirical research are identified.",
      "Key Recommendations": " In the growth area of investigating the knowledge translation interface there are encouraging signs, with funding bodies allocating resources to this area that is, for innovations in knowledge translation research. The Australian National\nHealth and Medical Research Council has recently funded a Centre for Informing Policy in Health with Evidence from\nResearch (CIPHER) that will conduct knowledge translation research, and develop and test specific knowledge translation research methods and tools.\n\nEmpirical investigations should be conducted and compared across different jurisdictions of public health policy and practice. It is important to understand programmes informed by evidence-based reviews, as well as implications of potentially premature programme dissemination. Case study research would help to understand these occurrences and inform evidence-based practice.\n\nThe common theme of these future directions is the growing overlap of building and applying evidence. While early stages of intervention development and testing are often conducted in a research-focused paradigm, to achieve population impact, policies and programmes must be implemented in real-world situations, and often in larger-scale settings than the original studies may have permitted. If the described translation processes both generate and employ more policy-and-practice relevant evidence, the ‘gap’ between research and practice will become less relevant.\n",

Evidence has shown that the results of rapid and full reviews are not much different, although the scope of the former is narrower. Since the evidential needs of the iodine case deliberations were specifically related to appropriate formulation and dosage, a rapid review appears to be a suitable approach to support policymaking in this instance.",

      "Key Findings": "At the start of the project, only around one quarter of the world’s children had access to Hib conjugate vaccines, partly because of high \nprices, and because local vaccine manufacturers did not master Hib\nconjugate technology. To address this problem, the RIVM/NVI has\ndeveloped a vaccine production process based on proven publicly\navailable knowledge, and has transferred this technology to several\nstate-owned and private industrial partners. Clear objectives were\nset from the very beginning of the project and consistent financial\nsupport helped to achieve these. The simplicity and the robustness \nof the production process have facilitated its adoption by the part-\nners. Between eight to ten years after inception of the project, this \nHib conjugate vaccine has since been licensed as both a lyophilized, \nas well as a liquid formulation, either alone or as part of combination vaccines. In all instances, it has proven to be consistent, stable and immunogenic in humans.\n\nThe transfer of the Hib conjugation process has resulted in access to the technology for emerging manufacturers in developing \ncountries, and in an increased and sustainable supply of afford-\nable Hib conjugate vaccines, through the establishment of a level \nplaying field and the stimulation of competition among manufacturers. Transferring the Hib technology to vaccine manufacturers in developing countries helped them in getting access to modern\ntechnologies that were not available to them before.

This information spanned all six\nWHO health system components. Ten key health areas where developed countries have the most to learn from the\ndeveloping world were identified and include, rural health service delivery; skills substitution; decentralisation of\nmanagement; creative problem-solving; education in communicable disease control; innovation in mobile phone\nuse; low technology simulation training; local product manufacture; health financing; and social entrepreneurship. While there are no guarantees that innovations from developing country experiences can effectively transfer to developed countries, combined developed-developing country learning processes can potentially generate\neffective solutions for global health systems.",

This has been resolved via complementary contract mechanisms enabling funding after SEADI terminates in 2013.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Value the evident strengths of SEADI, its team and “assets” being developed -- and to build on\nthem. In the vernacular; “What ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” In other words, there is a lot that is going well in SEADI, and it isn’t happening by accident.\n\nThe correlative Recommendation -- is to achieve more strategic overall focus, leverage, synergies, coherence across the project’s multiple components -- while at the same time\nbalancing USAID objectives with the “demand driven” operating modality. \n\nFocus GOI/USAID mutual interests more strategically on impacting priority integrative cross-cutting development themes -- to leverage SEADI’s remaining activities and limited resources:\nNow is the time for a new collaborative initiative to be undertaken by project leadership and Advisors, the USAID/EG Office, and key counterparts to examine, discuss, counsel and agree on a clear set of more strategic, purposeful, integrated priorities and cumulative synergies among the diverse multiple TA engagements.\nTake stock of -- and purposefully leverage -- the growing “assets and relationship equity’ being developed by SEADI advisors in concert with their counterparts;\nwork these assets more strategically in the variety of ways noted in this report.\nThe COR should familiarize himself with both counterpart concerns and the Contracting Officer’s protocols/preferences; also meet with procurement office each week or two -- to review the status of applications for clearance/approvals. These can be brief, even informal -- providing forums where the considerations of each party can be resolved, and\nbetter yet, anticipated.\n \n",

      "Key Findings": "KAEF is a success with respect to producing Masters degree graduates, although at a level somewhat lower than expected. As a conventional non-institutional development participant training\nprogram, KAEF has done very well. With its 100 percent success rate at U.S. universities and relatively high return rate, many other programs would be envious of its accomplishments. KAEF Fellows feel that their U.S. educational experience has already affected their careers very positively and will continue to do so. They are also convinced (and are able to provide anecdotal evidence to support) that, thanks to that educational experience, they are making a difference in their firms and institutions. The KAEF name\nis becoming increasingly known in Kosovo as a symbol of excellence. However, the 51 scholarships provided after eight years is less than the eighty or more expected at this point.\nKAEF has not performed as expected financially, and it will cease to exist if current financial trends continue. Whether justified or not, USAID and AC had higher expectations of the type of financing mechanism created – that KAEF’s endowment would become perpetual, allowing the program to continue indefinitely. Although it was probably inevitable that KAEF would need to use some\nendowment funds to get started, AC’s efforts to fundraise at a level sufficient to stop and even reverse those drawdowns have not been successful. Most of the revenue generated from fundraising has gone to cover its costs. As a result, the program has continued to run large deficits that have been covered by spending the capital of the endowment, leaving the endowment 27 percent lower than when KAEF began and the sustainability of KAEF over the long-term uncertain. Unless substantial new funds are injected into the program or the number of Fellows supported is slashed, KAEF will use up its funds and will eventually close. The amount of time that KAEF might survive is difficult to predict.",
      "Key Recommendations": "USAID and American Councils for International Education (AC) should consider the current fundraising strategy to determine whether there are options that might be cost-effective. AC should improve its reporting to USAID and KAEF Committee.\nIncrease Kosovar involvement in decision-making and in fundraising.\nReview options to increase the development impact.\nAddress the participation of women and minorities.\nFind ways to strengthen linkages.\nConvince more Fellows to return to Kosovo.",

      "Key Findings": "We describe the achievements and challenges across the four partnership goals.\n\nGoal 1: To integrate social and biomedical science research on chronic diseases of public health significance in Africa and for African communities in the UK through collaborative research between partners\nOur funding could not accommodate collaborative research and applications for funding to scale up our activities were unsuccessful.\n\nGoal 2: To influence chronic disease policies in Africa by disseminating evidence-based research and intervention to policy makers\nWe secured the participation of policymakers and donors from the Ghana’s Ministry of Health, Ghana Health Service, Malaysia’s Ministry of Health, WHO-Ghana Office, WHO-Afro, WHO, UNAIDS Nigeria\nOffice, Royal Netherlands Embassy and UK’s DFID to our 2007 workshop and 2009 and 2010 international conferences. \n\nGoal 3: To offer postgraduate teaching, training and support in Africa and in the UK on Africa-centred chronic\ndisease through teaching exchanges, research internships and co-publishing\nThe focus on teaching exchanges had to be refined because UK and African universities operated different academic schedules and it was difficult to synchronise timetables of potential visiting lecturers and host institutions without incurring significant costs. \n\nGoal 4: To disseminate partnership research and related activities to academic, health practitioner/policy and lay\naudiences through a partnership website, annual meetings and joint publications \nGoal 4 yielded the greatest consistent success. We organized two major partnership workshops in Ghana\n(NMIMR, 2007) and London (LSE, 2008) and coorganised an international conference with Monash University\nin Malaysia (2010). \n",
      "Key Recommendations": "We identified five key ingredients required to sustain our partnership that may be applicable to research partnerships generally:\n\n1. Social Capital: A basic definition of social capital is the shared understandings, values and links individuals and groups share that engender trust and collaboration. The importance of trust and mutual respect within partnerships (bonding capital) is emphasized by the majority of reflexive accounts of sustainable partnerships. Our partnership thrived, despite funding challenges, because these elements were present within our core working group. \n\n2. Measurable goals: Goals have to clearly be conceptualized, realistically costed and measurable in order to monitor and evaluate the relationships between inputs, outputs and outcomes. It helps to develop indictors for monitoring and evaluating goals at the inception stage. Beyond their utility in tracking progress, indicators also enable activities, responsibilities and expected outcomes to be transparent to all partners.\n\n3. Administrative support. Administrative support is necessary for non-technical aspects of partnership activities. Activities like organizing meetings writing reports, searching for grant proposals and developing grant proposal budgets can be time consuming and cumbersome.\n\n4. Creative and innovative strategies: Openness to new ways of using existing resources (within the group) and to securing additional resources (within and outside the group) can propel a poorly-resourced research partnership forward. \n\n5. For small scale partnerships to transition from the grant stage to the integrative stage, funding is required. The primary route is for partners to access competitive grants if they have the appropriate capacity to develop and submit proposals. \n",

The bifurcation break with center-directed and asymmetrical research and development initiatives in the South is rich with possibilities for improved transnational management processes and rewarding outcomes. In the wake of bifurcation, the range of symmetrical process- and outcome-path possibilities for THEPs is now bounded by the strange attractors of resource inequalities and collaborative decision making.",
      "Key Recommendations": "While the symmetrical path to process and outcome transformations in research and development governance is vulnerable to exhaustion or regression, there are ample opportunities for amplification of its emerging features.\nAlthough “traces of universal standards that attach value to whole system needs can be discerned in the turbulent flow” of symmetrical THEP activity, institutional-capacity and human-capability-building projects typically remain protected “islands of excellence”. \n\nPartnership roles and influence demand constant vigilance when funding sources are asymmetrical. There are real risks, for instance, that the research gap between North and South could widen and deepen even further. In a symmetrical North–South THEP relationship, power need not be symmetrical because the Northern university “may have a variety of reasons for not employing all the power resources at its command …”. However, participant, especially managerial, responses must be symmetrical and reconcile discontinuous change pulses.\n\nIn sum, THEPs are “fraught with instabilities which are likely to produce conflict …” while embedded with possibility for becoming “very productive”. In the vulnerable glocal governance context of complexity and turbulence, the management of THEPs requires keen anticipatory skills and functional and emotional transnational-competence-capability building.",

Facing limited budgets, governments along with firms and\nuniversities must make complex choices between collaboration in education or in research, between university collaboration with established firms (marching grants, consortia) or new firms\n(spin-offs, incubators), and between providing grants or developing science parks, among other\nfactors.",

      "Key Findings": "This study demonstrates that IAR4D has the potential to add value to the conventional research approach. However, the IAR4D impact on agricultural income at the country level was weak and, in a few cases, the conventional approach showed a greater impact than the IAR4D. There are two major reasons behind such a weak impact. The first is the short time the IAR4D operated. As discussed by Buruchara et al. (this issue), the formation of IPs and partnership, development and stakeholder alliances took a considerable time, as it involved about 66 stakeholders. The first seven IPs started functioning in 2008, while the other five started operations in 2009. Given that the end-line survey was done in 2010, this gives a short period of only 12 to 24 months of operation and is not likely to demonstrate a significant impact on agricultural income.\nThe second reason is the small sample at country level. Most of the results were robust and significant when data from the three countries were pooled. In addition, 10% of the farmers had not harvested their crops when the end-line survey was conducted, further reducing the sample size. However, the IAR4D impact on intermediate outcomes was greater. The IAR4D sites reported a greater improvement in rural services compared to those in the sites with the conventional approach.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "Given the weak impact of IAR4D on agricultural income, this paper should be interpreted with caution. Consistent with the external evaluation report, a follow-up study is required to verify the\nproof of concept of IAR4D.",

      "Key Findings": "In this examination on the role of African indigenous knowledge systems in promoting the relevance of higher education in South Africa, the paper concludes that the western approach to higher education in Africa is too academic. It has created a contradiction between learning and living among graduates by making higher education too distant from the developmental challenges facing the surrounding communities.\nThe graduates tend to be inadequately prepared to meet these challenges. The paper suggests that the holistic and community-based nature of AIKS could help to mitigate this contradiction due to its emphasis on the merger between theory and practice including the importance of using local languages in social practice, teaching, and learning.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "(i) The core business of higher education, that is, research, teaching and learning should be participatory by involving community knowledge holders in the core business of higher education; \n(ii) In order to provide guidance to the process of integrating AIKS into the core business of higher education, the promoters of AIKS should produce an African indigenous theory of “knowledge” based on the rich history of ideas and intellectual development in Africa. This indigenous theoretical framework should also clarify on the role and relevance of African indigenous languages in knowledge production and sharing in the era of globalisation; \n(iii) the experiences of integrating I KS in higher education at the North-West University in South Africa demonstrated that the sustainable development of the process requires a strong institutional commitment in terms of a conceptual understanding (on the part of the management) with regard to the importance of AIKS in higher education; human capital, finance and material support for the development of the various activities associated with AIKS in the core business of the institution.\n",

      "Document Title": "An introduction to the use of randomized control trials to evaluate development interventions",
      "Key Findings": "The purpose of this paper is to provide a short, non-technical introduction to RCTs. More technical treatments are available from Bloom (2006) and Duflo et al. (2006). The paper deals briefly with what is meant by impact evaluation, before moving onto the problem of selection bias and how it can be dealt with through experimental and quasi-experimental designs. Practical and ethical concerns in designing and implementing an RCT are then discussed before moving on to some of the criticisms which are commonly made of this approach, and, finally, challenges for practitioners of RCTs.",
      "Key Recommendations": "So, whilst there are alternatives to randomization for large n impact studies, these alternatives can be subject to various criticisms. Moreover, the simplicity of RCT designs makes them easy to present to policy makers: we took two identical groups and applied\nintervention X to one and not the other, after which outcome Y has improved by x% more in the treatment group. Hence, where feasible, attempts should usually be made to implement a RCT. Finally, RCTs are said to have limited external validity as they are often small scale trials run on a resource-intensive basis often with foreign researchers or their students running the intervention. The impact will be quite different once the program goes to scale using\nlocal implementation agencies and, probably, a lower level of resources. This argument also has some validity. Attempts should be made to ensure that the experimental pilot is as like to how the program will be in the scaled up version as possible. This issue should not be taken likely, as is the first of the challenges identified in the final section.",

      "Key Findings": "The principle findings contain two types, one is the value of the investment and the other is the recipient outcomes. For the former, the examination of the value of USAID’s investment in the CASS and SEED programs looked at resource efficiencies and effectiveness of implementation of the studied programs as conceived. Factors such as recruitment and selection of CASS/SEED scholars while ensuring recipients were supported in meeting their own objectives, as well as those of the program. CASS/SEED cost-share requirements for subcontractors are higher than average. However, CASS/SEED as it is currently structured is weak in its follow-up and support of recipients after they return home. As for the latter, the examination of the role of scholarship recipients as change agents was organized around the objectives of the program in terms of employment, leadership development, community participation and international involvement.",
      "Key Recommendations": "USAID should work on the following six topics to further the initial gains of the LAC program and increase understanding on the program’s overall impact. First, an in-depth study to examining why there appears to be a relative lack of program impact on recipient community involvement. Second should be an examination of the elements of the teacher professional development program that have encouraged teachers to continue to work in rural areas after training. Third, a continuation and increase on emphasizing computer training and use, which can facilitate international communication as a strategy to achieve global market participation. Fourth, USAID and SEED should consider addressing the potential of the non-recipient finalists, who generally have all of the capacity that the scholars have, but are left behind with no further support or input. A low-cost program involving a “buddy system,” in which a non-recipient works with a recipient on implementing an action plan or a class project, might be a low-cost option to be tested on a trial basis. Fifth, strategies used by other scholarship programs to broaden impact might be considered, given the evolution of resources in the region. Sixth, consistent with USAID’s education policy, future work should consider whether investing in secondary school completion for disadvantaged youth similar to those who had access to CASS/SEED. ",

It should be able to attract international partners that add prestige and credibility to the initiative. It should be gradual, and start\nwith a smaller number of countries that would be receptive to the initiative, rather than waiting for a world consensus for its launch.

      "Document Title": "Merit and Needs-Based Scholarship Program (MNBSP) Evaluation Report",
      "Key Findings": "The program provided scholarships to 1,807 students, 1,195 of whom have graduated to date. Accounting for estimated dropouts, about 1,604 (1,243 men and 361 women) students will receive MNBSP-supported degrees. Few scholarship recipients could have financed their education from personal resources. A majority (96 percent) of a sample of 605 alumni and current students who provided data reported that they would not have been able to continue their education without the MNBSP scholarship, a different scholarship, or a loan. Only three percent reported that they could have financed their degrees from personal resources. \nMost scholarship recipients (89 percent) understood that the U.S. provided the funding for the MNBSP. Furthermore, large majorities of MNBSP scholarship recipients view the U.S. and the American people favorably. \nUniversity officials suggested that HEC should expand the MNBSP to cover additional fields of study. However, the evaluation team found it difficult to get officials to prioritize specific fields into which the MNBSP should expand. \nMNBSP has met most, but not all, of its planned output and outcome targets. The program met its target for scholarship awards but did not meet targets for degrees awarded (because the targets did not account for dropouts.) The program has not yet achieved the target for female participation or for developing an online application system. \nAchieving the target of 25 percent female participation may require special efforts to publicize the program among prospective female students and/or consideration to increase female participation from urban areas. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "In consultation with HEC, reconsider the fields of study and the allocation of scholarships across supported fields of study in future scholarship programs. Scholarships in business administration are not consistent with current HEC priorities as articulated in the MTDF. However, scholarships in business support other HEC initiatives such as small business innovation research grants; the office of research, innovation and commercialization; and business incubation centers. The MTDF also emphasizes study in scientific, technological and engineering fields that are not covered under the current MNBSP. \nIncrease outreach to women. Achieving the target of 25 percent female participation may require special efforts to publicize the program among prospective female students and/or consideration to increase female participation from urban areas. \nConsider modifying eligibility criteria for women. If USAID desires to target female students from “remote/vulnerable” as opposed to “rural” areas, a more robust definition of “remote/vulnerable” may better serve this purpose. \nIdentify and resolve causes of delayed payments. Improvements in the payment mechanism are required to minimize the significant hardships delayed payments currently cause scholarship recipients. USAID could influence the speed of payment by helping identify and resolve bottlenecks and by trying to influence policies at specific universities that require students to pay tuition even when the scholarship is delayed. \nEnsure that the scholarship covers all education expenses. The scholarship award should cover all education related expenses (e.g. research expenses) of the students and should be awarded for the entire duration of the degree program. ",

      "Key Findings": "Phase two is mainly a consolidation phase and BSU will continue to comprise the seven universities in Denmark and eleven research institutions in Ghana, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda and Nepal. Focus will be on institutional capacity building, including strengthening the capacity and quality of PhD Bachelor and Master education, strengthening the capacity to undertake research and disseminating research knowledge to stakeholders, and supporting PhDs. \n\nBSU will also continue to be organised in four thematic platforms: 1) Human Health; 2) Growth and Employment; 3) Environment and Climate, and 4) Stability, Democracy and Rights. However, the coordination and collaboration between the platforms and with other donors and actors will be strengthened in phase two as well\nas the south-south collaboration. \n\nPhase two will be implemented according to the conditions already agreed upon with Universities Denmark for phase one and two of BSU in terms of co-financiering requirements and allocation between institutions in Denmark and in partner countries. The overhead for the Danish partners will remain the same (20%) whereas the overhead to the partners in the South will be revised to a maximum of 12%.\n\nThe main conclusions of the review were that the partners in the South value the focus of BSU on institutional capacity building, including the sandwich model used for capacity building of the staff member, and BSU is not perceived as a funding programme for research activities.\nThe current BSU structures (management, governance and  ommunication) are assessed as appropriate by the partners in Denmark and in the South, although it had taken some time in the start-up phase to get all the practical things working smoothly.",

In terms of alternative uses of funds, dividend payments by firms seem to divert from their spending on R&D, but investments in financial assets do not. In terms of ownership structure, empirical results show that both higher domestic ownership concentration and higher foreign ownership tend to lower cash flow sensitivity of R&D investment, suggesting more stable funding of innovation. Overall, there does not seem to be an extreme preference of firm shareholders for short-term returns at the expense of long-term productivity. However, there is clearly a gain for firms as well as economies they are in with better access to external financing of R&D.",

      "Document Title": "Higher Education Commission: University and Technical Support, and H igher Education Support Program",
      "Key Findings": "The First Cash Transfer, which covered university budgetary shortfalls and financial assistance to IDP students, made substantial contributions towards restoring the budgets of recipient universities. The US$8.43 million (Rs. 708 million) in funding provided by USAID covered 75 percent of the budgetary shortfalls at the nine universities that received this support.\n\nThe financial assistance to IDP students was provided to all IDP students and had no gender targets or objectives. Nevertheless, the assistance had gender implications in the sense that it benefited few women relative to men. The “inequity” in the distribution of assistance did not reflect a deliberate choice or a design flaw, but was entirely the result of women being underrepresented among IDP students relative to the student bodies at their universities as a whole.\n\nFaculty and students who use the labs and equipment benefit from their use. They provide practical training (thus enhancing students’ job prospects), strengthen existing academic programs, support new programs, facilitate accreditation, and help universities establish research links with the public and private sectors.\n\nThe cash transfers were instrumental in allowing universities to continue their key activities. Officials at all universities the team visited reported that funding constraints were negatively affecting their operations. The cash transfers were instrumental in allowing universities to maintain normal operations.\nBoth cash transfers directly contributed to USAID’s anticipated results in education programming as articulated in DO 4: Improved Access to High Quality Education, IR 1.3: Increased Access to Scholarships, and IR 1.1: Improved Educational Facilities. \n",
      "Key Recommendations": "Since the specific cash transfer programs that were evaluated have been completed the recommendations/lessons learned are aimed at improving future cash transfer programs and other programming support to higher education. \nWhen USAID provides assistance through a government organization, the source of funding may not be apparent to the ultimate beneficiaries. If USAID expects its assistance to improve public perceptions of the U.S., it should find a way to ensure that beneficiaries know the source of the assistance. Recommendations for improving the visibility and effectiveness of USAID assistance include: \n1. Requiring recipients of assistance to more explicitly attribute the results of assistance to USAID; \n2. Requiring implementing partners and recipient institutions/organizations to maintain accounting records that can identify USAID’s assistance; \n3. Hire externally or budget for a public relations activity to promote USAID’s assistance; or organize launching events for faculty and students. \n4. Although not as much of an issue at the time the cash transfers were made, ultimately, an unreliable and limited electricity supply restricted the usefulness of USAID-funded laboratories and equipment. In the future, it may be useful to consider the relative costs of including a package of assistance aimed at addressing any potential anticipated obstacles (e.g., including generators) against the possibly limited benefits of the equipment if these problems do indeed occur. \n5. Providing cash transfers to HEC appears to be an effective way of meeting USAID's higher education goals. HEC's deep knowledge of Pakistan's universities helped it to place the funds where they were needed \n\n",

      "Key Findings": "Interventions aimed at getting children into school work. The overwhelming majority of studies find positive impacts on\nboth enrolments and attendance, so the average treatment affect is clearly positive (see appendix 2).\nAnd interventions aimed at getting children to stay in school also work. Although the average effect is weaker, overall studies\nassessing impact on drop out and progression found positive effects (see appendix 2).\nLearning outcomes also improved. While there are fewer studies, the overall effects size for all four learning outcomes was positive,\nbeing strongest for maths and language, and weaker for global tests scores and ‘other achievement’ (see appendix 2).",
      "Key Recommendations": "The evidence shows that providing materials had no impact on school attendance or language test scores. The evidence counters the argument that providing materials works to draw more students into the classroom by providing an incentive. Some interventions seem ineffective because studies pooled together found no significant results. However, decisions about the effectiveness of these interventions should be made with caution, given the limited number of studies. \nFurther, there were several promising interventions e.g. teacher resources, new school buildings, CCTs, early childhood development interventions, school based management and school feeding programmes all had significant positive effects on schooling outcomes but more studies are needed to confirm these findings. \nThe final caveat is that few of the studies reviewed were carried out with difficult- to – reach populations. New approaches need be tried and tested for these groups. \n",

The iterative process of reflection enables project participants to: (1) learn more about their communities, about themselves and about the knowledge they have co-created; and (2) identify requirements for further action.\nWorking together with project participants in these case studies, we created new ways of knowing, understanding, doing and feeling as a result of our PALAR experience.\n\nRecognition of outcomes in the PALAR process – of both action and learning – is important as an affirmation of collective and personal achievements and must be celebrated as such.\nRecognition and celebration are usually not the final step in the research and learning process, but rather the next step in a new cycle of the PALAR process that engages communities – in partnership with universities – in sustainable, community-centred development. \n",

      "Key Findings": "PDPs’ capacity building in low- and middle-income countries at the\nindividual, institutional, and system levels shows that these PDPs advance public health by ensuring their products’ registration, \ndistribution, and adoption into national treatment policies in disease-endemic countries. Nonetheless, ensuring broad, equitable access for these populations— high distribution coverage; affordability, particularly for the poor; and adoption at provider and end-user levels—remains a challenge.",
      "Key Recommendations": "To achieve equitable in-country access, parallel investment in health policy and systems research, which does not necessarily fall within the scope of PDP activities, is likely to be required to overcome health system barriers to high-volume delivery.\nGerminal research is being performed by PDPs in relation to the availability, affordability, and adoption of their products, which might be scaled up in the future.\n\nUltimately, MMV and DNDi, in particular, are better than the pharmaceutical industry at developing novel and inexpensive products for neglected diseases and at supporting access to their products. Although this suggests that PDPs should not limit their role to product development, they may need to clarify or redefine the scope of their access activities in relation to other global health partnerships. \n\nTo assist PDPs to identify where their comparative advantage lies and how far their role in access should extend, their access and delivery achievements should be compared with those of the Global Fund and UNITAID. \n\nFinally, DNDi needs to better align its activities with its capacity building objective. If the long-term intention is to promote the development of independent, competitive research institutions and scientists in LMICs, this may require changing the nature of the HAT platform and the Leishmaniasis East Africa Platform and their evaluation indicators. Although MMV appears to be meeting its limited capacity-building goals, it should adopt a broader approach that aims to enhance LMIC research systems. ",

      "Document Title": "Open Distance Learning for Development: Lessons from Strengthening Research Capacity on Gender, Crisis Prevention, and Recovery",
      "Key Findings": "While the use of e-learning as an educational delivery mechanism is still nascent in sub-Saharan Africa, experience from this program shows that it has high potential to reach out to a large number of learners with limited resource costs. However, the problem of slow internet connectivity and difficult access to the internet, at times, frustrate the learners and demotivate them to participate in e-learning. \nThis pilot course also provided the lesson that the course should span at least eight weeks in order to allow participants to develop the proposal concurrently as part of the learning process. In addition to the proposal development course, the participants also brought up the demand for courses such as measuring impact, detailed data analysis techniques and methodology, and using econometric and statistical software for data analysis. \nFurther research is needed to identify the best combinations of e-learning and the face-to face program, best mode of delivery, best combinations of reading materials and the discussion sessions, and ways to improve motivation among the distance learners. In this context, the importance of promoting opportunities for developing course contents as open educational resources and using them effectively in the distance education programs cannot be overemphasized.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "Designers of the e-learning programs need to fully understand the background and the needs of the learners in order to increase the relevance and the utility of the program. Matching the skills needs with the content could optimize the learning speed and make the learning process effective. \nMake the learning program user friendly: Adult learners are increasingly becoming accustomed to internet based learning platforms. Yet efforts to increase the user friendliness of the e-learning modules can help reduce the fear of the technology and focus on the content of learning. \nLearners have varying degrees of absorptive capacity depending on their ways of learning. One way to reach out to all learners is to provide a variety of learning activities that cater to different types of learners. Modules should help visual and auditory learners. \nSelf- motivation remains a major challenge in an e-learning program. There is need for constant attention to inclusion of activities that bring the participants to the course and reward them for their efforts. This is a particular challenge in the courses that do not offer credits that could be used towards larger accomplishments such as a diploma or a degree. \nFinally, flexibility of course schedule is crucial for the learners of different speed to catch up with the course content offered at various points in time. Spreading the course assignments throughout the course period gives an opportunity for the moderators to be in regular touch with the participants and increases the active engagement of the participants. \n",

      "Key Findings": "Given the importance of human capacity in development, economic growth and social stability, it is no surprise that higher education policy occupies an increasingly important place on national policy agendas. The widespread recognition that higher education is a major driver of economic competitiveness in an increasingly knowledge-driven global economy has made high quality higher education more important than ever before in both industrialized and developing countries.\nHigher education contributes to social and economic development through four major missions:\n• The formation of ‘human capital’ (primarily through teaching);\n• The building of knowledge bases (primarily through research and knowledge development);\n• The dissemination and use of knowledge (primarily through interactions with knowledge users); and\n• The maintenance of knowledge (inter-generational storage and transmission of knowledge).\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Concentrate USAID Investments: focus on a few countries, combine system level interventions with comprehensive long-term institutional partnerships\nCapacity building efforts that are spread too thinly will be ineffective at addressing the complex\nchallenges facing higher education in SSA, and thus it is critical that USAID have an intentional,\nconcentrated approach and focus efforts strategically in a few countries.\n2. Intervening at the Institution-level: Institutional partnerships should be at the core of USAID’s efforts in HICD in higher education and these partnerships should be long-term, comprehensive and focused on making a transformational difference.\nWe urge USAID to invest in long-term and comprehensive partnerships at the institutional level to build human and institutional capacity. \n\n3. Professional Development of Faculty and Staff\nGiven that African universities suffer from a shortage of qualified academic staff and high student teacher ratios, effective faculty and staff development is critical to improving institutional capacity. \n4. Strengthening the Capacity of Institutions to Use Labor Market Data to Improve Quality and Relevance\nIt is essential that HEIs understand what skills and competencies are demanded by the labor market so that they can better equip their students for employment. \n5. Strengthening E-Learning and the Use of Information and Communications Technology in Higher Education\nIt is clear that recent technologies are leading to new and effective ways of teaching for many students. There are many indications that new technologies offer the potential to make significant positive changes to the quality of teaching and access to education. \n\n",

      "Key Findings": "Improving the resilience of communities to natural disasters requires that advances in earthquake engineering research are disseminated and implemented in practice and policy in a timely manner. Earthquake engineering would benefit from a comprehensive knowledge translation strategy with guidelines for researchers on developing a knowledge translation program.\n\n\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "Researchers need to understand what forms of published information are most useful for engineers in their work, how they search for and access that work, and how aware they are of current peer-reviewed research. Specifically, organisations need to encourage researcher to not just produce excellent research, but to engage with end users and come up with joint solutions to help facilitate use of new technologies. \nSecondly, engaging stakeholders in the research process and incorporating research findings into practice takes time and is difficult when organisations don’t support or recognise these activities. Both research and practitioner organisations need to invest sufficient time and money in engagement with knowledge translation activities.\nUnderstanding how policymakers use research in their decision making and how to present information in a useful way can help researchers more effectively engage in the policy process. For example, research will be of increased relevance to policy makers if it incorporates an analysis of contextual factors such as economics, public perceptions, and local applicability.\nFinally, improving the resilience of communities to natural disasters requires that advances in earthquake engineering research are disseminated and implemented in practice and policy in a timely manner. A knowledge translation framework has been successful in closing the gap between research, practice, and policy in health and other fields, but more research is needed to adapt and implement this framework in the context of earthquake engineering and related fields.\n\n",

      "Key Recommendations": "This study supports the view that while societies are at different stages of economic development, so too correspondingly are their CLEs, their QES and IC. While all education sectors have an important role in a knowledge economy, the quality of the higher education system acts as a catalyst for developing and nurturing creativity from preschool to post-doctoral centers. \nBy reviewing countries that have performed highly, such as Switzerland, Singapore and Finland, this study identifies best practices of their higher education systems. These can function as guidelines for countries that wish to improve the quality of the education, for creativity and innovation.\nThis study finds that the education system for a knowledge economy needs to ensure that people have the necessary infrastructure/infostructure to access high quality education. Further, they should enhance intellectual capacity through emphasis on active learning as seen in research, international links and problem solving, and knowledge transfer with other leading educational centers of excellence. Also required are smart partnerships with key stakeholders within the country and across the globe to enrich learning. \n\nFor institutions and individual staff within them, the implications are that educational directions need to go beyond the subject content and the local setting. At appropriate levels according to the institution’s degree of development, focus needs to be on active and applied learning, outside the classroom and away from the text book. These are approaches that need to be encouraged, supported and rewarded at the institutional and individual staff member levels.\n",

      "Key Findings": "We found strong evidence of TE impact on the earnings of graduates in LLMICs. In terms of macro-level economic benefits, there is evidence that TE has a stronger impact on growth than was previously assumed. The impact of TE on income equality is more difficult to isolate and appears to vary significantly, depending on context. There is some evidence to suggest that TE has a positive impact on productivity in the workplace, but the relationship is not conclusive. Evidence of economic impact is most robust at the individual level, with macro-level relationships being harder to identify, largely due to methodological differences between studies and likely barriers to impact in many contexts. Studies indicate that research output in lower-income countries is generally low and that there is limited transfer of technology to firms. \nThere is some evidence to suggest that an increase in the proportion of workers with higher education may increase the likelihood of technological adaptation. There is also limited evidence of local impact through technological transfer to small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). A number of studies show a positive impact of tertiary-level study on graduates’ capabilities and the strengthening of institutions (both formal organisations and social norms). Impact was shown in areas of health, nutrition, gender equality, democratization and the environment. However, the studies included were dispersed across a broad range of different forms of benefit, and further research is needed.\n\n\n\n",

      "Document Title": "Mid-Term Assessment of the Excellence in Higher Education Liberian Development (EHELD) Project",
      "Key Findings": "It was noted in the literature review that there are significant challenges in working with and building the capaci-\nties of inadequate systems that are themselves dependent on other inadequate systems in order to function or improve. This post-conflict context challenges all institutional capacity development initiatives. Even given these contextual challenges, the EHELD project has implemented most of the expected EHELD project activities and deliverables.\n\nThe EHELD project has been providing inputs and development to two very different universities, and two very different disciplines. EHELD determined that many of the local faculty members were unable to meet the teaching demand for courses across the entire subject areas required, especially for the revised curricula that includes experiential learning. In the short term, the need for additional capacity was met through contract and visiting faculty from outside of Liberia. The impact of the decision to focus on contract faculty and training new faculty was two fold. On the one hand, the students taking the classes from the contract and visiting faculty are impressed and grateful for the quality of instruction and attention they receive from these instructors. On the other hand, the existing local faculties at the two universities have not fully engaged with the EHELD program or the CoE concept. Existing personnel at the universities are described as treading with caution and reservation in spite of all the inputs. Additionally EHELD\npoints at problems of regular attendance of some local faculty. Local faculty perceive that they are not seen as integral to the EHELD-supported program and, in some cases, are concerned about their place at the University when the future faculty being trained abroad return.",
      "Key Recommendations": "It is important to empower the stakeholders to ensure institutionalization and sustainability. For the remainder of the project, EHELD should focus resources as much as possible on developing ownership and sustainability for those components of the project that are (a) showing results and (b) are acknowledged and supported by the host university or other stakeholders.\n\nThe creation of a CoE will take a team effort and should include all stakeholders and beneficiaries. From this point forward, EHELD needs to focus on outcomes, i.e., utility and ownership by the universities, and not just focus on achieving the PMP’s targets. The PMP helps to monitor inputs and outputs, but EHELD needs to consult with all of the faculty more closely to help them understand, address, and support the utility of what has been delivered. This will go a long way to engender ownership by the faculty and, therefore, the university.\n\nThe private sector should be engaged on an ongoing basis and be part of the planning process for activities so they will know when to provide relevant input to the university academic programming\nand Summer Start, as well as planning for internships. EHELD should reach out to new directors or presidents of relevant private sector companies and other participating organizations to introduce and orient the person(s) to EHELD, its purpose and relationship to the organization, e.g., Firestone. As with other stakeholders, EHELD should maintain regular communication about the project’s accomplishments. The development of the Liberia Engineering and Agriculture Group (LEAG) to work with EHELD and the universities’ Student Career Services Centers to develop internships may address these issues in part.",

      "Key Findings": "Propensity score matching analyses shows that the R4D program has statistically significant positive effects on household participation in cassava markets, adoption of improved varieties and crop management practices and household food adequacy. R4D does not have a statistically significant effect on yields and gross margins. The tests conducted suggest that bias due to selection on unobservables may not be severe enough to invalidate the impact estimates. Bias may still be a problem that is present in the analysis. But there is evidence based on the tests that it may not be a substantial issue in this case",
      "Key Recommendations": "The finding that controlling for observables the program has positive effects of treatment on some short-term outcomes implies that policymakers can increase impacts on long-term outcomes. Policy makers can promote R4D programs by first expanding farmers’ access to markets, then increasing availability and farmers’ access to disease-free clean planting materials of improved high yielding varieties that are resistant to diseases and pests, disseminating improved crop management and post-harvest management technologies, increasing farmers’ organizations, knowledge and skills to increase on-farm yields and profits and improving extension, marketing and infrastructure services. There is a need to promote the program even if it does not statistically significantly increase yields and profits in the short term because these outcomes depend on other pre-conditions such as farmer knowledge and skills, farmers’ organizations, effective farm gate prices and infrastructure. It is difficult for policy makers to develop these prerequisites the short term.\n\nAlthough the program does not have a statistically significant effect on yields and profits, the significant program effects\non market participation, variety adoption, and food adequacy merit further promotion of the program since these positive outcomes tend to be pre-conditions for realizing long-term yield and profit benefits. Future studies need to collect panel data and to apply panel data methods to control for the many unobservable characteristics in order to more rigorously assess the causal impact of R4D on yields and profits.\n",

      "Document Title": "Beyond two communities - From research utilization and knowledge translation to co-production?",
      "Key Findings": "Past models for knowledge translation all carry the basic underlying notion of research and policy as two separate, disconnected communities. These models include assumptions that researchers operate outside the policy process, that the locus of power is in the policy world, and that the point of persuasion is at the interface between the research world and policy world. This 'two communities' approach overemphasizes both the heterogeneity between domains and the homogeneity within the domains of research and policy. Research shows that that boundaries between research and practice in collaborative and advisory settings are never as clear cut as they appear and are, rather, negotiated in practice. The notion of co-production starts from the viewpoint that science and technology are so much inter-woven with the ways in which the societies are organized and the way in which we live our lives, that these domains should not be studied in separation of each other. The second key component of co-production is its ‘anti-deterministic’ stance: rather than conceptualizing the influence of scientific and technological developments on society as a linear, one-way process (science and technology influencing society), the notion of co-production recognizes that such developments are as much formed and influenced by social practices as they shape these practices (mutual influence of science and technology on society and vice versa). Research shows that there are often boundary configurations of science and policy actors rather than predefined boundaries between science and policy/. Policy makers can be involved in theoretical discussions, whereas researchers also use political skills.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "The concept of co-production offers a useful approach to studying structural collaborative formats between researchers and policy makers or professionals. It is important to analyze not only how the boundaries between research and policy can be bridged, but how - and at what moments - these boundaries are maintained, redrawn or re-established, and for what purposes.",

      "Document Title": "Pakistan -United States Science and Technology Cooperation (S&T) Program : Mid Mid-term Performance Evaluation Report",
      "Key Findings": "1. As judged by the program participants interviewed for the evaluation, the S&T Program has enhanced the skills of Pakistani researchers, including soft skills (such as critical thinking, creative problem solving, innovation, and analytical reasoning) and the ability to use new laboratory equipment and research methods, in carrying out applied research. The exchange visit component, in particular, has contributed to improved skills, and so has working with new equipment.\n2. Pakistani program participants believe that the program has also strengthened the capacity of the institutions where Pakistani researchers are based by investing in researchers' skills, financing new laboratory equipment, and helping improve students' research opportunities and the teaching imparted to them.\n3. The S&T Program has a strong thrust toward academic publications and conference presentations. Almost all of the grants have resulted in academic publications, most of the research work has been presented at international conferences, and the average output per grant is impressive: 5.2 publications and 7.1 conference presentations per project for the 73 phase 1-4 projects. Achievements such as these are associated with enhanced international recognition for Pakistani researchers and their partners; they are also achievements in Pakistan-U.S. collaboration.\n4. Improved skills among researchers and students represent human capital that will yield a flow of benefits in the future. Thus, these skills, supported by laboratory equipment that is maintained, can contribute to international standards research in the years to come. Sustainability of results will be enhanced wherever researchers receive follow-up grants from S&T and other sources (as many have among the researchers interviewed) and establish effective linkages with government and business entities (which a few of the interviewed researchers have done).\n5. The S&T Program is recognized by program participants as an avenue for mutual understanding and goodwill between researchers from Pakistan and the U.S. This recognition, combined with the involvement of researchers' students in the program, the addition of laboratory equipment at Pakistani institutions, and continuing efforts by some Pakistani researchers to work with U.S. institutions, represents progress in collaboration between the Pakistani and U.S. research establishments.\n6. The benefits of S&T-funded research for business, government, and the general public have been limited and the program confronts challenges in generating such benefits. Researchers identified elements of the macro environment that limit impact beyond the research setting, but these elements are beyond the control of S&T. The evaluation also found that research projects are not designed (and not required to be designed) in partnership with the ultimate owners, sellers, and users of research products, an omission that can be rectified by the program.\n7. The program has also been unable to overcome some of the challenges to sustaining its results: there is little evidence that Pakistani researchers' institutions have allocated resources for maintaining equipment, or introduced policies for sustaining research that harnesses improved researcher skills and institutional capacity. The program has not developed instruments for ensuring the sustained operation and maintenance of equipment.\n8. The S&T Program is avowedly merit-based and Principal Investigators (PIs) are expected to include women in their projects. In practice, women are included in S&T research to a limited extent, and this could be a reflection of male dominance in scientific research. The program has not introduced some of the means that are available for establishing more equal gender participation (outlined in the evaluation recommendations below).\n9. Funding, procurement, visa, and other problems have continued to affect researchers involved in the program for several years, and many of these problems lie beyond the control of the program. Significant problems in program management have evidently not been addressed in a systematic manner so far, although many researchers expressed the need for resolving them and the program managers in Pakistan felt that solutions are possible.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. The program should add three methods for encouraging applied research to the grant announcement, proposal, and selection processes. These recommended measures are: (a) clarify in the request for proposals how the program intends to promote applied research; (b) require researchers interested in applied research to demonstrate partnerships at the proposal/application stage with specific business and government entities for which they intend to produce certain products or solutions; and provide written confirmation of common objectives and contribution from such entities. \n2. The S&T Program should require Pakistani researchers who include equipment in their proposals to submit plans for the sustainable operation and maintenance of the equipment, including their institutions’ written commitment to allocate the space, staff, and finances required for this purpose. \n3. The S&T Program should consider various options, in a stand-alone or mutually reinforcing mode, which could lead to greater inclusion of women in the program. One option is to specify a progressively increasing quota for female PIs in terms of the proportion of funding or number of grants. The quota could be for the program as a whole or for specified focus areas, including those (for example, agriculture) in which there are few women at present. \n4. In consultation with program sponsors and implementing partners from Pakistan and the U.S., USAID should commission a management review focusing on known problem areas, including those highlighted in the evaluation. \n\n\n",

      "Key Findings": "The Learning Project (LP)  has been part of a mix of initiatives that are fostering significant change in CSIRO’s approach to R4D.\nThe experience from the LP shows that changes in understanding and practice need time and engaged leadership, and that engagement of actors outside their comfort zone needs to be supported.  A key challenge for both future studies and practice is to gain a much clearer\nunderstanding of the political economy of prevailing conservatism and to identify ways of institutionalizing systemic learning as part and parcel of the research and innovation process.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Donors and research leaders need to address institutional capacity that affects how research staff are then deployed. It is also important for the staff of organizations that seek to foster innovation in R4D to engage in their own processes of learning from experience and promoting institutional change within their own organization. Requisite institutional change for systemic innovation is not likely from any single initiative. The role and impact of leadership appear to be critical, and a better understanding of this is warranted as part of generating conditions that support institutional change. We conclude that the following are also required: \n(i) appreciating or understanding the institutional landscape and its complexity,\n(ii) appreciating which institutions constrain and which enable, and (iii) knowing how to institutionalizefindings/learning - that is, project/programme sustainability.",

      "Key Findings": "1. Restrictive regulations make the procurement of equipment and consumables for research extremely slow and unnecessarily complex, decreasing research productivity, publication potential, and speed-to-market of innovations\n2. Government research grants do not compensate universities for the salary of teaching faculty’s research activities, an unusual practice outside of the Philippines. This creates unnecessary financial competition between research and teaching missions within universities and diminishing institutional commitment to the research enterprise, except in the presence of visionary university leadership.\n3. Highly optimistic expectations of patent licensing revenue undermine collaboration between universities and industry at all levels.\n4. Widespread mutual distrust and disregard between universities and industry introduce significant friction into the innovation ecosystem. Most universities perceive assisting companies as outside of their core missions, and as risking exploitation. Businesses, in turn, report difficulty in convincing universities of their shared interests, resent the suspicion harbored by academia, and don’t trust universities to deliver commercially relevant research in a timely fashion.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "STRIDE identified the following four areas of improvement for the innovation ecosystem that warrant immediate attention from stakeholders.\n1. Reform of procurement rules for research activities is needed to achieve speed, efficiency, and relevance.\n2. Changes in counterpart funding in research grant structures are needed to align university researcher incentives and potentiate R&D. Promote more realistic expectations of university\nIP revenue based on global benchmarks.\n3. More appropriate expectations of university patent licensing revenue based on global benchmarks facilitate better industry-academe collaboration.\n4. Building stronger university-industry relationships around shared missions and goals.\n",

      "Document Title": "What methods may be used in impact evaluations of humanitarian assistance?",
      "Key Findings": "Impact evaluation methodologies may be used constructively to understand impact, to assess program design that might be best suited to a humanitarian context, and to help understand the most  appropriate method of delivery to the time of response and context of the humanitarian disaster. Ethical concerns about the impact evaluations of humanitarian assistance are valid and can be addressed, making impact evaluations feasible from an ethical point of view. There are many constraints that impact evaluations need to overcome in humanitarian situations. The robustness of studies can be especially compromised in the absence of baseline data and inability to plan for and construct counterfactuals. The need for speed of action and low predictability of such situations also means that little advance preparation is possible. However, it is possible to conduct rigorous impact evaluations in humanitarian settings successfully and in an ethical manner. This is often achieved by adjusting research designs to program realities. Very often, there are many decisions that field staff need to make that can be well-informed by impact evaluation methodologies. Finally, this study shows that the data requirements of impact evaluations are not as onerous as commonly suspected. In many cases, researchers may draw upon pre-existing datasets than can help evaluations in providing proof of balance, as well as providing them with insights into context.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Robust impact evaluations in any sector require the following:\n•\tA well-defined theory of change\n•\tGood informative research to understand the context and background of the initiative \n•\tExplicit and implicit counterfactuals that help measure what would have happened in the absence of the intervention \n•\tQualitative and quantitative baseline and the end line in data\n•\tA well-defined set of beneficiaries and outcome variables \n•\tIdentification methods that use these data to quantifiably measure changes in outcomes that may have occurred due to the intervention; \n•\tThe ability to use evidence in other situations and contexts \n\nResearchers and donors can better prepare themselves for conducting impact evaluations in humanitarian settings by learning where humanitarian emergencies may unfold, planning ahead for intervening when an emergency unfolds, and preparing impact evaluation design in advance. Being prepared to conduct rigorous impact evaluations also preparing the national and local capacity, understanding, and support for impact evaluations among donors.\n",

      "Key Findings": "The evaluation team believes that the following five elements contribute to CSISA’s distinctiveness in R&D in India, Bangladesh and Nepal:\n\n--the concept of the hub for an alliance of key stakeholders to focus R&D\n\n--the emphasis on service providers for appropriate mechanization adoption\n\n--the mix of private- and public-sector partnerships\n\n--cropping systems perspective\n\n--the validation of prospective technologies in participatory on-farm trials\n\n--the effective integration of supportive, socioeconomic and policy research",
      "Key Recommendations": "The following is a selected list of recommendations. A fuller discussion of the ET's recommendations can be found in the Recommendation section (see p. 40).\n\n1. We recommend continued emphasis on the following R&D activities that are central to CSISA: \n• Optimization of rice-wheat production systems in Bihar and Eastern Uttar Pradesh in India \n• Optimization of rice-based production systems in “low-yielding” Kharif rice systems typified by Odisha (also relevant in\nJharkhand and other states of East India)\n• Optimization of rice-based production systems in central and northern Bangladesh, including Rangpur and Mymensingh\nhubs, each with about 15 million people\n• Optimization of rice-wheat production systems in the Terai of central and western Nepal; hill-lands R&D to continue only\nif appropriately funded\n\n2.We recommend that in Phase III, CSISA-India draft as project outputs one to three carefully crafted ‘investment-grade’ joint proposals in collaboration with the state governments of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh to massively disseminate the ‘early’ rice-wheat cropping system. These large joint endeavors may also benefit from assistance of the Investment Center of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), perhaps with funding for formulation from the Asian Development Bank or from the International Fund for Agriculture Development (IFAD), if necessary.\n\n3. We recommend that one or more donors enable CSISA, perhaps with support of other partners, to delineate soils and water resources, in parallel with studies on socio-economic constraints for “rabi fallow” zones in Odisha, to enable the targeting of sustainable intensification research.\n\n4. We recommend that CSISA-MI be strengthened, perhaps with support of other advanced water management partners, to assist the Government of Bangladesh to formulate and map out strategies to mitigate saline toxicity in its mandate area of southern Bangladesh.\n\n5. We recommend that USAID and/or BMGF support mechanization in hubs in northern and northwestern Bangladesh where private-sector partners need science support on mechanization.\n\n6. We recommend that in order to stimulate greater integration between agronomists, who are undertaking specific and process research, and plant breeders, who are working on rice and wheat \nvarietal development, we recommend that CSISA consult and explore, with national agricultural research systems’ (NARS) leadership, workable protocols enabling NARS scientists to appraise and advance breeding lines in controlled on-farm \nenvironments in India, Bangladesh and Nepal.\n\n7. We recommend that plant breeding continue to be an integral part of CSISA in Phase III for South Asia. Crop management is rapidly changing on the Indo-Gangetic Plain. Varieties need to be selected to optimize dynamic new production systems, especially emphasizing early maturity, heat tolerance and resistance to plant diseases that are emerging with the new production interventions. Close interactions between breeders and agronomists will reinforce the process of change and accelerate the turnover of improved new cultivars.",

      "Key Findings": "This gender strategy ensures a systematic incorporation of gender considerations throughout the food systems innovation cycle to ensure that both men and women food systems actors benefit from food systems development interventions. \n\nThe objective of this gender strategy is to improve the effectiveness of GCFSI’s research and innovation in enhancing productivity, food security and incomes through gender-responsive programming and gender equitable implementation. More specifically, the strategy is intended to strengthen GCFSI’s development impact through the integration of gender issues throughout the Center’s innovation lifecycle to ensure that women benefit from the Center’s contribution to improving agricultural productivity and poverty reduction, enhanced resilience to climate change, improved food security, improved nutritional status, and enhanced workforce development systems.",
      "Key Recommendations": "This strategy document advocates for two approaches to support gender integration into the innovation process: \n\n1. Integrating Gender in the Innovation Pipeline. Evidence of gender issues identified through gender analysis should be systematically fed into the innovation lifecycle, where it provides critical input for the design of food system innovations. The goal should be to ensure that designed innovations are responsive to the priority needs of men and women food system actors.\n2. Strategic Gender Research. Organizations should conduct diagnostic gender specific research using gender analysis methodologies or other gender analytical frameworks to orient food systems innovations and development activities. The findings from such research will enable an organization to deepen the relevance of its research; realize innovations that incorporate gender issues in food systems; as well as improve on the applicability of innovative solutions to the complex food system problems. \n\nThe following recommendations are also provided:\n\nWork with thematic area faculty: \n-to identify appropriate sex-disaggregated data\n-to provide input in the design of data collection instruments\n-to establish the relevance of gender to a specific food system problem\n-to identify and prioritize areas that will bring an important contribution\n\nWork with innovation grants:\n-Review innovation grant proposal\n-ensure that the innovation grant implementation teams have sufficient capacity for gender integration\n-Build innovation grant recipients’ capacity for gender integration\n-Monitor and serve as resource\n\nWork with others:\n-Build networks and partnerships\n-Build partners’ capacity for gender integration\n\nWork with GCFSI Management Team:\n-to develop indicators for measuring gender integration into grantees activities\n\n\n",

      "Key Findings": "The analysis finds that the delivery of projects with impact evaluation is significantly timelier: common delays are avoided and the gap between planned and actual disbursements is reduced by half. Evidence-based mid-course corrections, a clearer implementation road map, strengthened capacity on the ground, and observer effects are possible channels to explain the results. The study presents evidence that impact evaluation may help improve project implementation, and concludes that projects with IE are more likely to implement their activities as planned and, in so doing, are more likely to achieve their objectives.",
      "Key Recommendations": "The introduction of IE might help avert the need to push disbursements out toward the latter half of project duration, or to restructure and cancel nonperforming projects. Future research can help better inform this debate. First, research should focus on understanding the underlying mechanisms through which IE research affects the path of project implementation and tracing the pathways through which these effects can be strengthened. Second, research should focus on quantifying the benefits of timely project implementation on development outcomes and identifying whom the benefits accrue to.",

      "Key Findings": "Inclusive Capacity Building: The involvement of practitioners and external stakeholders in knowledge exchange and information sharing was a good practice and therefore an important approach in enhancing the link between the academic sphere and practice. The growing interest among students, faculty and staff at UoN to attend seminars and public lectures whose speakers/presenters were drawn from external stakeholders reflects this.\n\nImportance of Institutionalization: Partners learned that it takes time to mobilize support within the UoN system (the department and UoN management, Senate, University Council) to support a project’s institutionalization. Because of CSDES’s success, its institutionalization is being fast-tracked. The UoN administration has expressed the desire that CSDES be upgraded from a center to an institute to give it wider mandate within and without the University.\n\nValue of engaging Drylands Communities: CSU-UoN partners realized that communities and counties in drylands areas are ready and willing to take up research findings and there is a high demand for well-designed/practical research outputs and \n technologies. Furthermore, the project realized that it needs to collaborate closely with other partners to build the human/technical capacity of communities and county governments to facilitate application of sustainable land management practices, governance (in natural resource management), and economic growth and resilience building.\n\nHost-Institution Ownership of Partnership Activities: Partners learned the importance of transferring project responsibilities to local partners early in the project’s life cycle. By supporting local (CSDES) staff and building leadership early on, the partnership knew that it would have better opportunities for sustainability. By the end of the partnership, almost all activities were transferred to CSDES including reporting and tracking finances.",

Key conditions include (1) recognizing\nthat science is a crucial but bounded input into water resource\ndecision-making processes; (2) establishing conditions for\ncollaboration and shared commitment among actors; (3)\nunderstanding that social or group-learning processes linked\nto science–policy interaction are enhanced through greater\ncollaboration; (4) accepting that the collaborative production\nof knowledge about hydrological issues and associated\nsocioeconomic change and institutional responses is\nessential to build legitimate decision-making processes; and\n(5) engaging boundary organizations and informal networks\nof scientists, policymakers, and civil society.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Given the expanding envelope of variability within\nwhich multijurisdictional decisions about water must be\nmade, failure to ‘invent’ new, conducive, institutions and to institutionalize conditions for better decision making pre-\nsents significant risks to society and ecosystems. Moving \nforward, therefore, systematic and comparative assessment \nis required to identify the full range of conditions for science–policy success (and those conditions that create barriers) across a large sample of transboundary river basins in a diversity of jurisdictional settings (e.g., international,\n\nsubnational). Even with the application of the five conditions we have identified, some failures in bridging science and policy are inevitable. An ongoing commitment to foster collaborative knowledge networks is required to deal with change in transboundary settings.",

      "Document Title": "Mid-Term Evaluation of the Indonesian Higher Education Leadership and Management (HELM) Project",
      "Key Findings": "LESSON 1: A robust design and proposal can help a project withstand even the most extreme challenges including extreme distortion of the original design; particularly the increase from 25 to 50 higher education institutions across the whole of the archipelago and the truncation of the original time frame for carrying out key strategic and analytical tasks, a serious time gap between the release of the request for proposals and the mobilization of the HELM contractor, and flux in project personnel including those in the most senior positions.\n\nLESSON 2: A project that is advertised as building human and institutional development capacity for leadership and management must ensure that it reflects the principles of HICD and provides strategic and effective leadership and management. Higher education institutions internationally and certainly in Indonesia are notorious for their organizational rigidity and for working in silos. An implementing partner must take care to ensure that its organizational structures and technical units do not \n mirror the very organizational issues faced by its counterpart organizations. For example, the four core areas of HELM operate in isolation from each other and do not yet exploit the synergies and other benefits that could come from internal collaboration. If the project does not demonstrate competence in applying HICD principles and practices and forward looking strategic planning and management, the stakeholders may call the credibility of the project into question. This is counter-productive.\n\nLESSON 3: A lesson often cited in international development literature over the past two decades is that institutional development is a medium- to long-term endeavor and donor agencies should expect to invest in such an initiative at a respective institution for a minimum of 10 to 15 years in order to see results. HELM is a five-year project, so it is already compromised regarding the ideal implementation period. The challenges the project has faced with building the capacity of DIKTI and institutionalizing desired change within partner organizations without a clear strategy that is informed by a risk assessment further compound the situation.\n\nLESSON 4: Strategic communication for development purposes should be a serious endeavor. A lack of investment in this area will result in investment waste in other areas. For example while a series of very high quality literature reviews and research studies have been produced by acknowledged international and local experts, the insights contained in these documents have not communicated effectively to a range of audiences. This situation ultimately means that the very individuals the products are intended to benefit are not utilizing the knowledge products.\n\nLESSON 5: Shifts in socio-cultural norms open up spaces for groups that are excluded from participation. If a project is able to recognize and respond to these openings, it is often the case that a very small investment can yield significant dividends. The Women in Leadership initiative is a case in point: for a small project investment that covered the cost of around 50 – 60 women and men to attend a short workshop and then for a small investment on the part of their home institutions to conduct a short seminar for selected female staff, significant and unexpected dividends emerged. If HELM is able to exploit this obvious low-hanging fruit, the project will have helped bring about a substantive development results that will have far-reaching, and ultimately quantifiable, effects. However, if the project is unable to seize the day and the response to such an opening is timid or unfocused, the opportunity will be lost.\n\nLESSON 6: A good indicator can be hard to find. But if a project wants to tell the story of its real achievements as convincingly as possible, good indicators that conform to sound principles must be identified. These indicators perhaps sit beneath or alongside required USAID indicators and they tell the story of achievements that goes beyond reporting on numbers on metrics of interest to the project. Up until now, HELM has not found the right indicators that enable its story to be told and that reveal, rather than obscure, the emerging development results.",
      "Key Recommendations": "RECOMMENDATION 1: Hold an intensive workshop to focus HELM implementation on consolidation of results from activities, \n sustainability and institutionalization for the final two years of the project. Without an all-out effort to regroup, develop and embed a strategic plan into HELM, the end results of the project and the overall development impact will suffer.\n\nRECOMMENDATION 2: Act immediately to ensure the quality, relevance and appropriateness of the executive/professional development for higher education leadership and management materials.\n\nRECOMMENDATION 3: Bring the HELM databases up to a generally accepted standard. To do so, contract STTA with bona fide credentials in database design that can apply accepted principles and norms for database design, including the development of unique identification numbers. HELM monitoring and evaluation personnel will then need to clean and re-interrogate the existing HELM data.\n\nRECOMMENDATION 4: Prioritize the approach to the 25 new Cohort 2 institutions in the following ways:\n\nRECOMMENDATION 5: Produce a gender and social equity analysis and gender and social equity integration strategy in collaboration with the 50 HEIs and DIKTI and BAN-PT. An immediate action that could be carried out is to ensure that the Women in Leadership action plans are initiated at all 50 HEIs. The strategy should recognize that HELM has only two years remaining. While the gender and social equity analysis may not make a significant contribution to HELM implementation at this point in time, the output of the exercise may help inform future USAID investments in higher education. Beyond the self- efficacy indicator, ensure that the HEIs track and report on the number of women who move up the ladder as a result of HELM empowerment activities and change in men’s attitudes about and advocacy for female empowerment.",

In addition, they have been able to find cost savings and adjust the program as\nneeded.\n\nFinding 2. A particular dimension that was emphasized by many individuals who were interviewed concerns the difficult operating environment in Egypt over the past several years. For example, CDM and CDM-CIU leaders and USAID-Egypt leadership and program management staff note that the program was mobilized and has survived through nine changes of Ministry of Higher Education ministers each of whom became convinced of the value of the program and two of whom are seen as its champions.\n\nFinding 3. CDM-CIU personnel whom the team interviewed appear to know how to carry out their specific administrative functional tasks well. Staff pointed out that the way that the CDM-CIU\nworks is very different from the way the rest of the CDM works.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Recommendation 1: Redesign the HICD to reflect a more realistic approach (see recommendation section of the report for a step by step guide).\n\nRecommendation II: Appraise the short-term overseas training program for 20 CDM personnel and 100 English Language training program personnel. Include the appraised training program in the CDM’s overall development strategy.\n\nRecommendation III: Recruit and hire at least five new CI staff to fill much needed administrative roles and higher level positions, including a CI Liaison. The Liaison should be tasked with solving\nproblems that arise between the US and Cairo.\n\nRecommendation IV: Improve the Scholar Action Plan (see recommendation section of the report for a step by step guide).\n\nRecommendation V: Be highly selective in providing masters degrees for MBA programs, select thirty percent female and only those with the highest marks and language skills. Please see Annex for fleshed out gender recommendations.\n\nRecommendation VI: Use the break between Phase 1 and Phase II to improve existing processes; specifically do the following: Develop a long term cost plan, and Create Committees (see more detail in Recommendation section).\n\nRecommendation VII: Improve the equitable distribution of opportunity to the scholarships; a few options towards reaching this goal include: a statement in the annual advertisements regarding women to allocating a percentage of awards to organizations in underserved regions.",

      "Document Title": "Feed the Future Ethiopia: External Mid-Term Performance Evaluation Report",
      "Key Findings": "An overall assessment of progress against indicators suggests that output indicator targets are generally likely to be met. There is no strong evidence to suggest that levels of effort and resources are\nnot appropriately matched to the achievement of output targets. Impact and outcome targets in key areas of finance, employment and business development are less likely to be achieved (when such targets have been specified). This may be due to factors beyond the manageable interest of the FTF program, but it may also reflect the diffuse nature of market‐based interventions and the limited coordination between such projects. The achievement of objective‐level impact targets is more problematic still. While it is possible that there may be significant improvement in indicators to the targeted levels and beyond, it is unlikely that any of these targets will be met as a result of program interventions alone.\n\nThe USAID Ethiopia DO1 and FTF development strategies have not been completely aligned and as a result, the causal pathway linking project interventions to the FTF objectives and goal is not always\nrobust. \n\nThe introduction of a coordinated interdepartmental FTF program should have been undertaken in parallel with the introduction of a dedicated portfolio management system. This did not occur and as a result, the capacity of management to achieve the necessary oversight and to respond in the event of unforeseen developments has been compromised. \n\nThe value of reported data for FTF program management is compromised by a number of factors. There are no PMP targets for a number of FTF indicators, which limits the usefulness of such indicators and prevents direct assessment of the extent to which available resources are adequate to meet program objectives. Some indicators aggregate data from sources that do not bear strict comparison, while others are subject to varying interpretations by different projects. Still others may be incorrectly\nentered into the FTFMS.\n\nAlthough there is a consistent gender component throughout FTF and despite the fact that all data was gender disaggregated, it was not always evident that the gender concerns were fully addressed. In some cases, when indicators showed female participation in activities to be lower than planned, project teams did not appear to have reflected on why this had occurred, and whether the activities they were promoting met female needs.\n\nAs one of the largest FTF portfolios globally, FTF Ethiopia is in a unique position to provide lessons learned not only for future USAID Ethiopia projects, but to inform FTF more broadly. Currently neither the knowledge management components of projects, nor efforts at the Mission, are sufficient to capture these experiences and share them.\n\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "Evaluation of the FTF contribution of each project should be restricted if possible to those woredas in which each project is operational.\nProgram design should take the economic characteristics of households within the ZOI into account prior to designing interventions. A baseline survey undertaken across the ZOI after program design has been completed and the work begun has little formative value and is useful mainly for monitoring. \nFTF projects should align with GoE guidelines, but should endeavour to ensure that all aspects essential to successful development are incorporated within the manageable interest of each project, or ‐ given effective coordination between projects ‐ of the program overall. \nPortfolio management needs to be strengthened through support to dedicated M&E to ensure the collection of accurate data, the analysis of compiled results, and the generation of succinct reports on ongoing developments that can allow portfolio management to make informed decisions.\nIndicators should be revisited by Mission program monitors in conjunction with project M&E staff to ensure consistency and accuracy of data entry. \nGiven that one of the five main FTF programs is managed by ALT (GRAD), it would be helpful to overall portfolio management if there were to be greater involvement of ALT in the oversight of the FTF program.\nOngoing support should be provided to all of the above initiatives for the remaining duration of the program, and in particular that the successes achieved should be replicated in other projects where possible.",

      "Key Findings": "The four case-study universities had almost no explicitly stated philosophy with respect to HRM management in general and promotion of research in particular. Compared to the “ideal” HRM policies presented above, the four case-study Vietnamese universities have shown their recognition of lecturers’ research work to a limited extent.\n\nFor example, in hiring academics, PhD holders are welcomed, but no prior research performance evidence is expected\nThe literature suggests that, in recruiting academic staff, high-research-performance universities rely on candidates’ research performance and potential. In this study, all of the four universities welcomed PhD graduates, especially those graduating from developed countries.\n\nSecondly, in developing staff, academics’ formal qualifications are advanced; however, very few on-the-jobs up-skills research development programmes are provided.\n\nThird, in rewarding staff, academics with research performance are distinguished from those without; however, good performers are yet to be differentiated from more mediocre ones.\n\nIn short, current appraisal practices are only able to distinguish lecturers who did research from those who did not. But among those who do research, current assessment practices do not allow good performers to be differentiated from more mediocre ones. This performance assessment practice is criticized as being summative in nature, merely superficial, and more often than not, controversial. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "The study suggests that in realizing their visions of being recognized as research-intensive universities, the four universities must employ a strategic long-term HRM capacity-building strategy. They should provide stronger remuneration packages for research high performing academics, apply explicit indicators in assessing lecturers’ research performance, and build strategic research teams. \nIn the initial stage, Vietnamese universities should consider inviting the Vietnamese diaspora to return and create the most favourable conditions for them to maximize their contributions to institutional research development. \nThe ultimate aim is for local Vietnamese academics to gradually and sustainably boost their research capacity and performance. To ensure smooth transition and effective development, Vietnamese universities should provide local academics with relevant professional development programmes and support to nurture rather than immediately challenging their research capacity. However, in order for the four universities to implement these recommendations, there must be changes in the wider system level. The Vietnamese government must allocate more funding and confer a higher level of autonomy so that Vietnamese universities can implement their desired research-supported HRM policies.\n These universities should also keep in mind that while academic salaries are important, money alone is not sufficient. Once academics’ basic needs for a living are met, other non-financial matters may come into play. \nFinally, for research to be sustainably developed, a healthy academic culture should also be cherished, within national and/or institutional strategic research priorities. Implementation of these tasks would take a long time, sustained efforts, strong determination, and commitment; however, the ultimate outcomes should be highly rewarding.",

Group learning holds the potential to catalyze organizational impact by harnessing the collective intelligence of a learning group such as a cohort of scholarship recipients.\n\nConsider inclusion of families for US-based scholarships.\nThe most consistently reported recommendation from US-trained alumni was for the revision of the current USAID Indonesia policy against accompanying dependents on study-abroad tours\nby allowing trainees to apply for J-2 visas for immediate family members.1 This program policy adjustment would put USAID PT programs in line with the policies of other U.S. government-\nfunded scholarships for graduate study or mid-career training (Fulbright and Humphrey Fellowships) as well as with those of three additional major graduate scholarship programs for Indonesians: the Directorate for Human Resources, Directorate General of Higher Education (DIKTI); Indonesia Endowment Fund for Education (LPDP); and AusAid.",

      "Key Findings": "PEPFAR (President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief) OVC (Orphans and Vulnerable Children) definitions have changed since the program began. In addition to being required to select PEPFAR OVC scholars, EGF (Equity Group Foundation) was to select equal numbers of boys and girls, with 60 percent from Nyanza and Rift Valley provinces. In 2012, the 60 percent requirement was met. In 2013 EGF was to include 500 AIDS, Population, and Health Integrated Assistance Plus (APHIAplus) scholars, but included only 201, with 299 additional scholars reportedly from areas of high HIV prevalence also included. Of all USAID secondary scholars, 49.6 percent are girls and 50.4 percent are boys.\nEGF has had no general manager (GM) for monitoring and evaluation (M&E) for over a year and a half and had short-term staffing in that position previously. It is currently without a GM for education and leadership. While much data is gathered and reported upon, WtF (Wings to Fly) M&E policies and procedures have not been formalized. A contract with Kimetrica has produced a draft M&E framework to address this deficit. Certain M&E database fields (e.g., scholars’ home district) need substantial cleaning and currently prevent district-level analysis. FY 2014 quarterly reports show underspending by more than $570,000 each quarter and an average burn rate of 65 percent.\nWtF aligns with USAID’s Country Development Cooperation Strategy (CDCS) under DO2, IR 2.2, and its various sub-IRs. WtF is scheduled to end Nov. 9, 2016, and current USAID and PEPFAR requirements will remain applicable until then or until changed and approved by USAID. Future decisions (e.g., concerning funding sources, definition of terms, services offered, outcome emphasized) will determine if USAID will use current or revised indicators beyond that date. PEPFAR funds require continued use of two current indicators, including psychosocial support. EGF’s M&E does not yet support accurate reporting of all required indicators.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Equity: USAID should confirm with EGF the applicable definitions of 1) “OVC” and permitted beneficiaries under PEPFAR funding; 2) “psychosocial support,” identifying the WtF services and OVC types that may be counted and reported under this indicator (PEPFAR C5.6.D: Number of eligible adults and children provided with psychological, social or spiritual support); and 3) “mentoring,” specifying the WtF mentoring activities that may be counted and reported and under which indicators. USAID should also clarify for EGF and for the record the geographic requirement for scholars to be drawn from Nyanza and Rift Valley provinces in certain percentages. \n \nSuccesses and Challenges: If further PEPFAR funds are granted, USAID should emphasize selection of HIV-affected candidates, possibly through renewed requirement of APHIAplus involvement in scholar selection. Given the low burn rate, USAID should discuss with EGF budget reprogramming and adjusting activities in view of this evaluation to optimize WtF, with special attention to alumni needs. \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation (M&E): USAID should communicate new M&E requirements to EGF per the new CDCS results framework and confirm or revise existing indicators and develop new ones as needed for any ongoing, reprogrammed or new activities. Additional indicators are likely needed to track desired CDCS-relevant outcomes under the current program through November 2016.",

      "Document Title": "Rethinking the design paradigm for university technology projects in international development",
      "Key Findings": "The findings from the analysis suggest that the following aspects of graduate-level projects might be approached differently: (1) early-stage planning, (2) contextualization of the technology focus, (3) project timescales, and (4) the intent of community engagement.\nIn the case studies, the planning phase of the product development process occurred in creating the funding proposal for the projects and significantly influenced the subsequent stages. As such, more consideration might be given during planning to better identify a\nmarket opportunity, to manage the tension between the descriptive research goals and the normative design goals, and to determine the range of flexibility a project might have to adjust to a dynamic problem given its more rigid resources. The case studies highlighted a tendency to prioritize technology over context, reflecting the strengths and interests of the project teams. However, the literature suggests that in designing remotely for the \"developing world,\" challenges arise when users are not well understood and when the ecosystem within which a product is distributed is not fully considered. With regards to time as a resource constraint, the cases showed time pressures specific to the graduate-level projects. Academic commitments limited opportunities to travel and therefore limited the scope of the project work and the timescales and lifetime of a graduate degree or project did not match the time required for development to occur within a community. Lastly, in exploring the project teams' engagements with resource-constrained communities, the analysis suggested an ethical framework in which community members were not solely an information point, but were the reason the projects existed and a guiding factor for how the projects could be run.\nThe product development process may be useful as a structured framework for not only modeling and analyzing this catalog of projects but also improving the process.\nIn academic international development projects, universities/students are asked to not only produce research but also develop products. However, university graduate programs do not typically produce products-but they do produce learning, research, and new technology.\nTechnology-based research in-and-of-itself should not be a means for claiming innovation within the international development practice. Likewise, poverty alleviation should not be a means for creating compelling research programs. The ideal state occurs when both the academic and community impact are never considered merely means, but as the mutual and equal ends in themselves.",

      "Key Findings": "The review found that, in the decade 2004–2013, a surge in peer reviewed outputs relating specifically to indigenous tobacco control commenced in 2008. This surge probably reflects the extent of the research response after the 2004–2005 Australian National Tobacco Strategy four years previously, which identified the need for tailored approaches to reduce tobacco use among disadvantaged groups, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.\n\nA reduction in tobacco use by 2018 has been identified as the highest priority in addressing Indigenous disadvantage in health outcomes. Translation of research into policy and action must be accelerated to achieve these important goals. Overall, there has not been a systematic or explicit approach to research translation in the design and implementation of the research being done and reported, a deficit which should be addressed to assist with the needed acceleration of research translation.\n\nIn order to translate research findings to action in the public health domain, there is a need for effective research, that is, that which trials interventions in a real- world context. However, intervention studies remain costly and require considerable time and effort to develop and implement. A 2008 review of public health research outputs suggested that funding issues have influenced these outputs.\n\nThe literature reviewed contains many descriptive studies, the numbers of which are increasing, despite longstanding calls for a better balance with more intervention studies. A more strategic use of descriptive studies could be to focus them on discussing the more novel, ground-breaking topics.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Research efforts should encompass the geographical and cultural diversity of Australia’s Indigenous peoples\nAdequately resourced and well-designed intervention studies with a focus on efficacy are prioritized including those incorporating multiple baseline designs, participatory action and realist evaluation approaches\nGreater investment is made by states and territories for research to inform specific Indigenous tobacco control measures study proposals are more strongly aligned with previously identified and emerging research priorities, for example, trials of prevention of smoking uptake by Indigenous youth\nThere is continuation of regular national research priority forums representative of a wider range of knowledge users including policy-makers, practitioners and community-level stakeholders\nStructured integrated research translation approaches are included in study designs and evaluations with dissemination strategies that enhance opportunities for knowledge exchange with decision-makers\nThere is critical review of research translation components to develop a method of appraisal of both their use and impacts\nThere is further research that specifically examines the barriers and facilitators for evidence translation into health policy and practice.",

This COP should be action-oriented, working together on priority STIP M&E tasks (e.g., F standard indicator revision), and could do so through a virtual TDY, for example.\n\nIntegrate Further STIP/M&E across USAID: To leverage this important tool for development work, it is essential to help colleagues label current STIP work as such, identify STIP opportunities, understand that STIP is not an “add-on”, and provide Agency-wide resources in the STIP/M&E nexus. Examples include weaving STIP into Agency programming in an effective manner, such as clarifying “innovation” in mission RFAs (defining it as “better, faster, cheaper, more sustainable”), and requiring STIP indicators for new awards.\n\nChampion “Spatial Thinking”: To improve program design, decrease unintended consequences, and tell stories within and outside of USAID, geospatial tools and spatial thinking should be\nchampioned. Attendees noted the importance that each person act as a STIP/M&E Champion within their pocket of the Agency.\n\nIncrease STIP M&E Agency-Wide Resources: To support USAID priorities, as well as event takeaways, The Lab should create a STIP M&E Toolkit or One-Stop Shop for STIP M&E resources, including databases, individual bureau resources, and development partner knowledge.",

In order to address this issue, HED has since developed a number of protocols to ensure greater project engagement across stakeholders that are involved in the partnership.  ",

      "Key Findings": "The transfer agents were primarily trainers and practitioner experts, and the users were mostly health professionals and consumers of health services (mothers, young children, village populations). All the transfer strategies studied used multiple activities, with the primary activities being training, distribution of materials and local facilitators. The \nstudies mainly used quantitative designs, and measures of \ninstrumental utilization were the most often used; however,\nthe psychometric properties of the evaluation instruments \nwere rarely reported. The primary outcomes of the evaluated strategies were increases in knowledge being transferred to health professionals and greater use by the population of recommended essential products.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Our results highlight the need for systematic evaluation of the condi-\ntions for research results use in the settings where transfer \nactivities occur, to identify strategies that specifically target \nbarriers inherent to the context, according to the five cate-\ngories of conditions presented in Table 4. This step is likely \nto improve outcomes and reduce costs associated with using\nmultiple strategies, some of which are less relevant.\nWhile there is a need to increase the quantity and quality\nof research on transfer activities, there is also a strong need\nfor more knowledge transfer interventions in low-income\ncountries.\n",

      "Key Findings": "The study finds that impact evaluations are of increasing interest to the Peruvian public sector, although the greater demand is still for process evaluations. The preference for the process evaluation is associated to the fact that its focus is more directly linked to the everyday tasks and preoccupations of public officials and implementers, making it easier to grasp. \n\nResearchers also perceive that public sector officials are incorporating the language of impact evaluation, albeit mostly among top-level officers. However, use of evidence is still limited and quite heterogeneous across sectors. This evidence suggests that much more can be achieved to support impact evaluations in influencing programme and policy decisions. \nOut of the 37 studies conducted by experts from Latin American research centres, we find that only a small portion manage to influence programme or policy decisions, based on researchers’ perceptions: only about one in every four studies has managed to have any influence. \n\nMoreover, we find that the ‘influential’ studies share at least two of the following desirable features: intense contact with the implementer from the evaluation design stage, experimental designs, powerful external validity and publication of results. However, having these features is not sufficient to achieve influence. Even among impact evaluations characterised by intense contact with programme officers at the design stage, an experimental design and external validity judged strong by the researcher, only half achieved any influence on decisions related to the programme. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "Our qualitative data points to several potential strategies, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. The first is for the researcher to work independently, to persuade policymakers of the usefulness of impact evaluation for better policy decision making and thereby foster their collaboration. The second refers to the potential of an evaluation in which the researcher accompanies the intervention\ndesign process and applies that information in designing the impact evaluation. A third strategy acknowledges the importance of maintaining a relationship with the policymaker or implementer throughout the impact evaluation process but does not depend on them for the sustainability of the study design – in other words, keeping an appropriate distance.",

      "Key Findings": "Despite the changes in economic perceptions, there are few impacts of NSP on objective economic outcomes. At midline, there is weak evidence that NSP induces small increases in the diversity of household income sources and in caloric intake, although both impacts do not persist after project completion. At endline, there is weak evidence of impact on the amount borrowed by households. NSP appears to have no robust impacts at midline or endline on income levels, income regularity, consumption levels, consumption allocations, assets, or food insecurity.\nThere is also no evidence that NSP impacts general production and marketing outcomes. NSP has no discernible impacts on agricultural yields, productivity, or the proportion of harvests sold, although the program induces a fleeting increase at midline in agricultural sales revenue. NSP also does not affect whether households sell animals or animal products or the revenue derived from such activities. \nAt endline and midline, there is evidence that NSP reduces the net migration of households from villages, although both results lose statistical significance if migration patterns at baseline are controlled for. In addition, there is no evidence at endline that NSP induces any changes in net within-household migration.\nFinally, the evidence of NSP’s impact on democratic values is mixed. There is strong evidence that NSP increased voting in the 2010 parliamentary elections, with the proportion of male and female villagers who claimed to have cast a ballot being 4 and 10 percent higher, respectively, in treatment villages. \n\n",

      "Key Findings": "Through its activities, SSHIELD has created a network of women leaders with the skills and knowledge to contribute to peace-building and social cohesion in South Sudan. Thirteen out of\nfourteen of the SSHIELD scholars completed master’s degrees in education by successfully completing their coursework and defending their theses. With additional support from Indiana\nUniversity and South Sudanese faculty, the fourteenth scholar is expected to defend her thesis while in South Sudan and receive a master’s degree. As a result of the training and experiences\nthey received from SSHIELD, all 14 women have returned to South Sudan and are now prepared to take on leadership roles in South Sudan’s educational system in areas such as curriculum development, teacher education, educational policy, and educational research. For its part, the visiting faculty program has not only prepared the 8 visiting South Sudanese faculty members\nto support the SSHIELD network, it also has equipped them to contribute to gender equity and conflict-sensitive curricula and policies in South Sudan.\n\nThe SSHIELD program graduates demonstrate that an ethnically and geographically diverse group of South Sudanese women can complete rigorous higher education degree programs and contribute meaningfully to the development of their country, especially during the ongoing crisis. With the SSHIELD network taking root and with the support of the Ministry of Education,\nthe situation is now primed for a change in the predominately male sphere of higher education in South Sudan.",
      "Key Recommendations": "While tremendous gains have been made during the SSHIELD project in strengthening the qualifications of program participants, further support is recommended upon their return to South Sudan to ensure that the SSHIELD network is empowered to make sustainable change in South Sudanese institutions and share their knowledge and skills with a broader number of students, teachers, faculty, and administrators.\n",

      "Key Findings": "Outreach: The three universities succeeded in achieving broad national outreach. Students were recruited from all of Lebanon’s 26 districts, with select underrepresentation in some programs from specific remote areas. \nMeeting Criteria: The findings support the conclusion that the applicants who are accepted into USP meet the criteria of high academic achievement and financial need for scholarship awards. \nThe student cohort is nationally geographically distributed with some underrepresentation of some remote districts, and contains a majority (60%) of female students. \nImpediments to Recruitment in Any Areas: Impediments appear to include: lack of community knowledge about USP in the communities that have supplied few students for the program, and the small schools with lower number of students to select from in some remote areas. \nPerformance: Program managers report USP students are among their best performers academically. USP students also perceive themselves as doing well in the program. Graduates achieved high Grade Point Average (GPAs around 3.3 over 4), and the majority of computer science students on the Dean’s Honor List at LAU are USP students. LAU reports 56% of USP students have GPAs above 3.2, compared to 29% of non-USP students.\nIntegration/Abuse, Disrespect: Students report some initial issues with their integration into the university community, but these tended to decrease in time. \nStudent Leadership: The USP program encouraged, supported and mandated an educational program that emphasized community and campus involvement, and leadership training and experience.  ",
      "Key Recommendations": "Expand Outreach: Continue and expand outreach visits to all public high schools with a special focus on areas which have been under-represented. Expand these visits to provide an orientation about the program to the community. Consider encouraging student and graduate involvement in the outreach program.\nEnsure that the Management Style of all USP University Implementers Reflect USP Program Values: USAID staff should ensure that USP Implementing Partners address and adhere to compliance concerns in order to effectively respond to all student issues of concern including respect, abuse, rigidity, confidentiality and other issues. University managers should ensure that, to the extent possible, their own management styles reflect USP values including: democratic participation in decision-making; negotiated settlements of outstanding issues; absolute confidentiality during counseling regarding student problems, issues and personality tests; and integration of USP students into all aspects of University life, including common spaces such as dormitories. \n Prevent Dropouts: USAID should review its policy on the possibility of granting a semester’s break to students in good academic standing who experience a serious psychological or physical health problem rather than dropping them from the program.\nProvide More Help in Selection of Majors: Recognizing the importance of the selection of a major to the entire university educational experience, universities should provide more information and assistance regarding the implications of choosing different majors in securing an employment, and strive to empower students to make an informed decision among a substantial number of choices.

      "Key Findings": "Focus Area 1 - Institutionalisation: The Periperi U partners have successfully continued their efforts to embed the disaster risk domain in their respective home institutions. Administrative and\nfinancial processes have been integrated into university systems, with most home universities providing significant in-kind contributions in the form of infrastructure, administrative support\nand staff time. In general, programme activities have had good support from university leaders and administrators - the result of what is seen as an important area of work from a national perspective that is also given credibility by external funding and, in particular, by a consortium of African universities.\n\nFocus Area 2 – Short courses: The targets in this stream were met in all but three partner nodes; for around half, performance in some aspect of this focus area was well above expectations. Although more courses were presented in Phase III (58 compared to 47 in Phase II; 19 of them in 2012), somewhat fewer participants were reached - 1,447 (average 25 per course) compared to 1,572\n(average 33 per course) in Phase II (this situation might still change as Phase III draws to a close). Participants came from a wide range of sectors and experiences, thus reinforcing the importance of\nthis focus area for reaching and building the capacities of stakeholders immersed in practice, and in many cases in influential positions.\n\nFocus Area 3 – Academic courses: Postgraduate courses in DRR/M are particularly important; they are seen by stakeholders as preparing a new cadre of professionals who can lead a range of\nactivities across sectors where this field of work needs to be embedded. Only UG chose to focus exclusively on integrating modules into existing academic courses as a result of their particular context. The implementation of academic programmes and modules continued in Phase, with partners meeting targets to the extent that they could control; two Master’s programmes (Moi and USTHB17) are still awaiting approval.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Key Recommendation 1: Improve critical performance areas of the consortium for sustained impact. Strengthen key capacities and management processes for durable, authoritative and\nimpactful results by maintaining those key aspects that enable success, building on strengths, and improving aspects of management.\n\nKey Recommendation 2: Attend to structure and responsibilities. Reconceptualise and/or strengthen the secretariat without weakening it, given its critical role as a major driving force and\nreason for the success of the consortium.\n\nKey Recommendation 3: Strengthen DRS scholarship through an emphasis on home institution capacities and research. Strengthen research and supervision to demonstrate and encourage\ncontext-sensitive, boundary-spanning, engaged scholarship in the disaster risk domain. This includes an emphasis on developing a critical mass of academic staff with proven capacities in\nhome universities.",

To promote the use of rigorous evidence to inform at-scale action, we identify two strategies to increase demand and four strategies to increase supply of Decision-focused Evaluations (DFEs): Funders should establish ‘impact first’ incentive structures that tie scale-up funding to demonstration of impact over a long time horizon; and funders should allocate funds to support DFEs across their portfolios. To build supply for DFEs: universities and funders should build and strengthen professional tertiary education programmes to train non-academic impact evaluation specialists; funders should subsidise start-up funds to seed decision-focused impact evaluation providers, and international evaluation organisations should support these organisations with rapid external quality reviews; evaluation registries should publish the cost and length of impact evaluations\nand the actions they influence; and funders, evaluators and implementers should collaborate to establish ‘build, operate, transfer’ evaluation cells to strengthen evaluation capacity in\nimplementing organisations.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Overall, to maximize the social impact of impact evaluations, all involved stakeholders (implementer, funder, and evaluator) should have clarity on each evaluation's primary objective and select the appropriate evaluation type (DFE or KFE) accordingly.",

      "Key Findings": "Our findings suggest that many of the IPs focus on technology testing and adoption, although there is increasing attention for gender and nutrition. Institutional dimensions of agricultural innovation (e.g. related to policy, markets and access to land, credit, inputs and services) are currently being addressed to a much lesser extent. We wonder hence whether these IPs reinforce rather than challenge existing agricultural innovation paradigms, and whether they have the potential to contribute to more systems-oriented approaches to agricultural innovation.\n\nIn that sense, we are witnessing the risk that IPs and other systems-oriented ways of working remain isolated cases of success rather than becoming broadly embedded in AR4D systems. This is despite efforts for better collaboration and exchange of experiences at the global AR4D level, such as in the CGIARâ€™s Institutional Learning and Change initiative.\nBy analysing the embedding of IPs through the lens of niche-regime theory, it has become clear that this is process of massive paradigm shift and mind-set alignment at both institutional and individual levels across the whole spectrum of stakeholders.\nSuch a shift is unlikely to take place only through isolated experimentation with new approaches such as IPs, but require structural and broad-based learning and capacity.",
      "Key Recommendations": "The transition from technology-oriented to system-oriented AR4D approaches requires structural changes in organizational mandates, incentives, procedures and funding, as well as investments in exchange of experiences, learning and capacity development.",

      "Key Findings": "In summary, findings from the HEI data analysis revealed that women are significantly underrepresented in key STEM-related degree programs (or majors) critical for innovation and growth such as technology and engineering (22 percent student female enrollment compared to 54 percent overall female enrollment in Salvadoran HE Is). Further, five year trend data for female enrollment in technology and engineering majors shows a worrisome decline from 26% to 22% from 2009 to 2013. On the other hand, enrollment data from science programs, such as chemistry and biology shows that females participate at around the same rate as males. With regard to faculty, females account for 36% of all professors, however they make up only 27% of faculty teaching STEM-related subjects.\n\nOverwhelmingly, focus group and interviews pointed to a culture of machismo that continues to influence El Salvadoran women's education and career choices and steers them away at a young age from STEM-related fields especially technology and engineering. Whereas male students never raised the issue of doubt, females often spoke about subtle and sometimes direct instances of objection and/or resistance from their families and teachers in relation to their choice of study.\n\nAt the same time, focus group discussions point to a changing mindset among young people, both male and female, that believe women need to be more supported in STEM -this new attitude, plus the existence of some women in key university and industry leadership positions - can help break long standing gender stereotypes, ultimately initiating change in higher education systems. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "Explore low-cost ways to raise awareness among high school girls about STEM degrees and careers, thereby increasing the pipeline of girls enrolling in STEM-related undergraduate degree programs.\nLeverage women in leadership positions in both HE Is and industry to raise the profile of females in STEM and higher education.\nThe Activity should encourage industry partners (CASATIC, ASER, ASI and CAMAGRO) to start collecting sex-disaggregated data on their members employees, preferably broken down by type of position.\nThe Activity should initiate a dialogue with industry partners to recommend gender integration in job announcements and promotions made by their business members.\nProvide technical assistance to the leadership of HE Is about the relevance of cross-cutting gender integration strategies, and the importance of promoting access to females for STEM careers in academia and industry.",

      "Key Findings": "The NORHED programme emerged after a long process of trial and error. Various Norwegian actors have a long history of cooperation with universities in the South. It has taken the bold step of putting actors in the South in the driving seat. The units of collaboration are universities themselves, and within these, the academics propose their own projects. It provides a framework that is based on input from the South as well as from actors in Norway. The international collaborations and partnerships that are intrinsic to the programme promote the awareness that trees can be grown in many ways and for many different purposes, and that through academic openness, knowledge and skills about how to plant and cultivate entire forests can be created and shared.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Our recommendations are as follows:\nNorthern partners need to develop a more accommodating approach to knowledge generation by acknowledging and recognizing the importance of indigenous and local knowledge in the South.\nSouthern partners (faculty and researchers) need to enhance their methodological skills, while taking local cultural uniqueness into account.\nFaculty members and researchers need to realise that their active engagement in developing clear understandings of project goals plays a significant role in the sustainability of collaborative research projects. Similarly, managers and project leaders need to formulate strategies to address the sustainability and mainstreaming of project goals and activities.\nStrong levels of commitment, rapport and understanding between and among Southern and Northern partners are crucial for the successful implementation of collaborative research projects. Existing  collaborations are developing deep roots and unique features that need to be carried forward by future project leaders.",

      "Key Findings": "Our reflections have demonstrated that the meta-theoretical positioning and core assumptions of PAR facilitate the adoption, dissemination and use of research.\nSpecific features of PAR that are pertinent to the research translation endeavor are as follows: developing and sustaining participation through egalitarian partnerships with communities, providing opportunities for participants voices to be heard directly, co-producing knowledge that is responsive to the social setting, promoting the realisation of agency and empowerment, and knowledge sharing.\n\nMany of the challenges relating to research translation link to issues of power.\nThis includes power dynamics created by economic inequalities, as well as dynamics relating to age, educational level, race and gender. In both cases, economic inequalities were reflected in the macro- and micro-contexts of the countries concerned, with the researchers (who are middle-income professionals) working in low-income communities. The socio-economic backgrounds of the researchers and communities therefore remained a constant marker of difference in the researcher–research community relationships.\nIn the case of the Multi-country Photo voice Project, age presented as a particular challenge given the focus on working with children. This required particular understandings and creative responses to specific developmental needs and a need to address the tendency of adults to dominate. The visual, aesthetic appeal of photographs notwithstanding, younger, developmentally immature participants were found to be more concrete in their engagement with the photographs and narratives. \n",
      "Key Recommendations": "We recommend that public health researchers intentionally reflect on the paradigm that informs their practice to ensure that research processes serve the interests\nof partner communities. Furthermore, we suggest that researchers strive for optimal participation of communities (referring here to the continuum of participation) using methodologies that are collaboratively decided upon. Most importantly, the power relations inherent in the research relationship need to be a key focus for examination, and reflexivity is integral to developing self-awareness.\nPartnership approaches can be co-opted by agencies that serve their own agenda and this potential instrumentalisation of PAR must be acknowledged, particularly in South Africa \nWhilst our theoretical lens, critical theory, highlights the need to realise agency through the research, the challenge is really the enactment thereof within the PAR endeavour. From our experiences we note that agency, which is critical for sustaining projects, must become an intentional strategy and outcome of the research, and not merely a by-product. Our recommendation is that such research be located within a theory of change, inclusive of the underlying assumptions and prerequisites for attaining a desired goal.\nPAR provides maximum benefit to local communities, providing real opportunities for personal and collective empowerment, and the development of knowledge and action that can be used to address social issues. We suggest that investing in participatory research is also beneficial to academics and funders by virtue of it providing processes for developing sound, relevant knowledge, while enhancing the likelihood of research being successfully translated into action.",

      "Key Findings": "In traditional forms of research, the meaning of evidence-informed policy and practice, efficiency, and impact is left to rational-technological interpretation, while alternative pathways and evidence are disregarded. Northern dominance and economic, technocratic, and transfer solutions prevail, and fail, in governance and innovation policy and practice. The integration of the wider public is too limited. Representatives of developing countries are usually outnumbered and sidelined in global negotiations. Resulting global policies remain top-down, power-driven, and sectoral.\nThe Eastern and Southern Africa Partnership Programme (ESAPP) offers a unique case study of transformative research. Experiences from ESAPP offer the following learnings:\n•        Established development policies and scientific culture are scarcely compatible with the experimental nature of sustainability research. Tensions between the need for flexible and adaptive procedures and the mainstream cultures of science and development cooperation largely prevailed, as standard procedures and formats such as log-frames thwart open-ended processes.\n•        Equity and inclusion are of particular concern in a complex North–South network such as ESAPP But a devolution of power and an expansion of deliberative capacity are utterly impossible to achieve within the North-driven standard procedures, formats, and budgets – which, due to a lack of adequate evaluation, acceptance, or understanding of transdisciplinary work – still dominate the way in which development programmes are assessed and perceived.\n•        A major strategic goal of ESAPP was to establish a well-functioning South–South research network capable of boosting research for sustainable development in Eastern Africa. But success was limited.",
      "Key Recommendations": "This paper advocates for a true sustainability transformation to advance North-South development cooperation and research. It discusses the conceptual and practical features that are supportive in framing and implementing research for sustainable development so that it can advance efforts to reduce poverty and enhance equity while promoting efficient use of natural resources. \nResearchers need to engage in action research, integrating knowledge systems and actors outside the scientific community and triggering joint learning processes in which they assume the dual role of generating knowledge and strengthening civil society for balanced exchange.\nThe focus of research at the science–policy interface needs to shift from the outcome to the processes of societal knowledge generation: to experimentation, learning, and constant change in an adaptive governance approach. Such science–society interaction requires new structures that accommodate democratic features: for example equity, inclusiveness, accountability, legitimacy, and deliberation.\nEquity concerns in research partnerships should be given broader and more rigorous attention.\nDevelopment actors and decision makers must invest particular attention and efforts in fostering the relevance and stability of South–South cooperation by ensuring that it is equitably and firmly embedded in all countries involved.",

      "Key Findings": "The effort to develop a wiki as a data repository for knowledge transfer and as a mediating technical platform for social learning in the context of a multi-country programme of agricultural research for development was largely unsuccessful. Participants were not storing, posting or sharing their personal reflections or\nlearning experiences, and there were evident disparities between original intentions, design and actual experience. Designing online spaces for collaboration is a complex process; there can be great disparity between original design ideas and what eventuates in practice. An obvious way to reduce the disparity is to include users in the design process, including also external research organizations, project recipients and collaborative partners. In the experience discussed, this was only partly achieved and began with what can be now understood as the wrong institutional ecology and conceptual understanding, with unexpressed prior epistemological commitments.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "Include users in the design process, including also external research organizations, project recipients and collaborative partners. \n\nAgricultural researchers Should dedicate time to critically assess and customize online technologies to facilitate a shared learning environment, and reflect on how design choices influence whether or not online participation becomes a part of everyday research practice. Collaborative negotiation of ethical protocols would seem a necessary collateral undertaking, to situate ethical practice appropriately and to learn about designing an ethical framework aligned with researching principles and praxis.\n        \nKnowledge management practices to enable joint analysis, tagging data, and analysing project narratives also would need to be established at the outset. It would also seem helpful to avoid a predetermined structure and engage facilitators to offer their interpretations back to the community for discussion, mentor adoption of online roles displaying diverse collaborative and learning capacities, and nurture social relations to build trust online and offline as part of a ‘seamless’ learning system, rather than framing the online environment as a differentiated space disconnected from offline research practices and social relations. \n\n\n",

      "Key Findings": "1. There is a concern that the University faculties have little ownership of the project, especially since they have very little say on its objectives and outputs. \n2. Political decisions by the GOK to reduce the tuition liability on students has adversely affected the budget of the UP, making it difficult for it to support investments in such areas as new technology. \n3. There is a huge mismatch of expectations at various levels. The UP faculty travelling to the partnering universities in the US.\n4. Licensing limitations and security concerns are making it difficult for US partner universities to give access to technology, especially to online databases and libraries, to foreign faculty in Prishtina, which is a source of great disappointment for UP faculties. \n5. Communication at various levels between the UP faculty and the various partnership universities, between Semester-in-Residence in US fellows and their mentors, and between the UP faculty and the international experts providing short-term seminars/workshops has been a challenge and is leading to misunderstandings about what can or cannot be done within the project. \n6. There are concerns related to the type and quality of advice provided by international partners to UP faculties, in that the international partners are perceived to be imposing their ways and methods on the UP faculty, without taking the local context and needs into consideration",
      "Key Recommendations": "• Despite the fact that the TLP project has faced several delays as a result of the political situation in Kosovo and the changes at University of Prishtina, the project is on track and WL would be well-advised to maintain the focus and direction, especially in the next year, which will be pivotal to setting in place processes that will have a critical impact on the final outcomes. It would be important for WL to begin collecting information on the indicators to ensure progress is as planned as the Partnerships component winds down next year and the project itself in a few years.\n• The UP Action Plan has not seen much progress since its inception and needs a lot of support before it can become operational. It will be important for WL to field the best team of consultants to help think through the three identified priority areas, and lay down critical markers of progress over the remaining time-period.\n• Further, US university partnerships are expected to contribute significantly to strengthening teaching and assessment quality, and success on this front would require WL to maintain relentless focus on details and linkages across the education-labor market continuum.\n• The high-profile support from USAID and GOK and the surrounding publicity seems to have resulted in a highly inflated set of expectations among the UP administration and the faculty, who\nlook at the project to deliver far more than what it is designed to. It is important to correct this at the earliest, especially since a high level of interest among these stakeholders is critical to drive\nsuccess of the project.",

      "Key Findings": "All scholars, regardless of context, perceived difficulty in negotiating the political terrain associated with SDP organizations. In addition, a prominent discussion point was the organizational landscape and complexities that hindered partnership formation during the assemble-and-form stage and ongoing sustainability as part of the transform-and adjourn\nStage. \nSecond, there was a challenge and barrier to forming research partnerships during the assemble and- form stage perceived by all of the scholars was the difficulty in developing partnerships with organizations that have limited funds to invest in research and evaluation. Specifically, it was noted how fiscal priorities for organizations tended to focus on their practical application and not research or evaluation efforts\nThird, was the scholars’ experiences of encountering differing goals, objectives, and understandings of community partners, particularly during the storm-and order and norm-and-perform stages, to the point where sometimes there was the perception of overt or covert community partner interference that undermined partnerships and ongoing, sustainable research efforts (transform and adjourn).\nFinally, scholars regardless of context pointed to various challenges with engaging in long-term research or evaluations with SDP organizations, which subsequently affected their research efforts (norm and perform) and ongoing viability of the partnerships (transform and adjourn).",
      "Key Recommendations": "Develop strategic partnerships. All of the scholars perceived that it was vital to be strategic in partnership formation during the assemble and- form stage.\nAnother important strategy perceived particularly useful during the assemble-and-form and storm-and-order stages, is the importance of developing a mutual understanding for the goals of the research partnership, and to involve the SDP organization in design of the research plan.\nBuild trust and relationships. All of the scholars, working in any partnership context, perceived that a critical strategy for assembling and forming and sustaining partnerships (transform-and-adjourn stage) was to give time and energy to building trust and mutually respectful, equal relationships with partner organizations.\nStart small. Several scholars believed that it was important to start out a partnership on a small scale(assemble and form) with an SDP organization to cultivate buy-in over the long term (transform and adjourn).\nFind the cause champion. Another intriguing tactic used by several scholars across contexts, principally during the assemble-and-form stage but also during the storm-and-order stage, was to identify a cause champion within the organization who can advocate for the importance of the collaboration and the research\nDevelop a track record of success. Finally, the scholars perceived that it was important to develop a successful track record in research partnerships with SDP organizations, particularly at the local level, to serve as leverage for forming new collaborations (transform and adjourn).",

      "Document Title": "A Community-Based Participatory Research Guided Model for the Dissemination of Evidence-Based Interventions",
      "Key Findings": "The CCM model is a promising approach to the dissemination of EBIs that emerge out of a CBPR project. The model is theory driven and includes attributes (e.g., compatibility, consideration of environment/context/setting, communication channels, strong links or networks) that have been cited by other researchers as influential to the pace and uptake of an intervention. The key CBPR principles also provides framework that can enhance these critical attributes.\n\nPreliminary results of the POP suggest that the model is helpful in achieving good adoption, implementation, and retention. In the pilot study, all five of the new community partners adopted and implemented the program and reached their target enrollment goals. Although the analysis is still being finalized, the initial assessment of the data suggests the few organizations that modified the intervention by abbreviating the schedule, while conducting all the lessons, had weight loss comparable to groups that followed the standard schedule. \n\nThere were few adaptations to the protocol among the mentees, but some minor enhancements were added.\nFor example, two groups created social media profiles (i.e., Facebook) for participants to share class information, healthy lifestyle tips, or related news. Within the span of a year, the\nPOP doubled the number of communities that implemented the intervention. We are currently in the midst of a NIMHD funded dissemination study guided by our CCM model that targets a larger number of potential mentee communities (i.e., communities served by Hawaiian Homesteads, Hawaiian Civic Clubs, community health centers, and Native Hawaiian Health Care Systems).",
      "Key Recommendations": "The CCM model extends the key principles of CBPR throughout the process of EBI dissemination by establishing\nco-equal, mutually beneficial relationships at its core. By strengthening social networks and positioning CBOs as leaders and mentors, opportunities are created for building critical consciousness, community capacity, and social capital. More research is needed to determine the effectiveness of this model of intervention dissemination which may enhance diffusion of CBPR interventions and empower communities in the process.",

      "Key Findings": "Collectively, HESN Labs met or surpassed targets for 27 out of 34 (79 percent) standard HESN indicators. High levels of indicators showing targets achieved represents the wide breadth of the HESN Labs’ performance across all three objectives of the Results Framework. While a third of goal-level indicators fell short of targets, overall there is no weak area of performance in the Results Framework.\nOn average across all indicators for all years, HESN Labs surpassed targets by 66 percent.  The strongest performance has occurred in the area of improving data quality, access, and analytics to advance evidence-based development decision making. The areas in which targets were surpassed by the greatest margin included not only datasets, data analysis, and training in data tools, but also in beneficiaries reached and communities participating in any kind of activity23 as well as participation in ecosystem24-building activities such as competitions (e.g., Berkeley’s Big Ideas) and summits (e.g., IDIN International Development Design Summits). \nIn addition to performing well against targets in this area, HESN Labs have made continued gains each year on 71 percent of the standard indicators. The only area in which HESN Labs fell short of targets for Objective 1 was the number of USAID operating units using geographic analysis to monitor and evaluate development projects (12 vs. 22 targeted). \nAll of the HESN Labs reported valuing the opportunity to engage with local partners during the development stage of innovation and said that HESN funding has been a critical factor in making this possible.  \n",
      "Key Recommendations": "HESN Labs should streamline activities, adjust resource allocations, and increase synergies based on the insights gained through the first five years. \nHESN Labs should identify the subset of activities, pilots, approaches, and partnerships with the greatest potential for generating sustainable impact, including likely high-potential activities currently under development. They should articulate a set of criteria based on this assessment that can be used to evaluate opportunities going forward. The utility of the activities, pilots, approaches, and partnerships should be assessed alongside Mission priorities. \nHESN Labs should identify the core critical operating functions and costs that will be needed to support this subset of activities, pilots, approaches, and partnerships. They should also identify the practices and structures that have created synergy and coherence among different value propositions and activities so as to maximize impact and resources. \nHESN Labs should update or replace the Business Model Canvases created during the midterm evaluation to correspond to the streamlined set of activities and use these as the basis for monitoring, evaluation, and learning. \nUSAID should extend funding to HESN Labs needed for core critical operating functions and costs, and should maintain the capacity for Missions and other operating units to use buy-ins to facilitate partnerships with HESN Labs. \nUSAID and HESN Labs should work together to hone an effective strategy for creating partnerships with USAID Missions, including a mechanism for USAID Missions and operating units to articulate challenges and needs to HESN Labs.

      "Key Findings": "The process of setting up a national R4D platform was not without considerable challenges in the start-up period partly related to differences in actors’ perceptions of implementation. An important factor was the nascent state of the Malawian NCST at the initiation of HRCSI funding. \n\nGiven Malawi’s history of primarily international funding directly to a small number of research centres, without strong engagement in national governance and management, the initial difficulties were perhaps not surprising, particularly given some of the tensions associated with health research capacity strengthening. In response to a similar situation in the Western Pacific, Rani et al called for substantial investment in “essential health research and management functions”, something which HRCSI did in the NCST. In the case of HRCSI, the challenges forced a reorganization and renewed emphasis on research management systems, which eventually bore fruit in sets of guidelines and procedures appropriate to a national R4D platform and enhanced national health research capacity. In terms of our framework of components, HRCSI did stimulate demand for health research, lobbied for domestic funding, engaged in coordination, developed research networks feedback and evaluation, promoted information sharing/knowledge exchange, and contributed to structures to promote research use. In terms of the 12 areas of performance for research councils, HRCSI became competent in managing over half: setting research agenda/research priorities, disbursement of research grants, disbursements of scholarships and loans, capacity-building/training of researchers, funding support for infrastructure development, valorisation of results, and supporting scientific publishing/scientific journals (n = 7). \n",
      "Key Recommendations": "Further bibliometric follow-up monitoring and analyses are needed to pick up the long tail of publication and assess its relationship to the National Health Research Agenda and its priorities. Assessment of the longer term impacts of HRCSI and its funded research would take longer but would provide an opportunity for  LIC R4D platforms to engage in follow-up evaluation which can support mutual learning.\nFinally, evidence on the course of R4D platforms in\nLICs remains limited, making a fuller discussion of the pros and cons of various approaches and the linkages with our framework of actors and components remain rudimentary considers how a research council or R4D platform’s performance might be analysed in relation to them. Given the paucity of case studies of health R4D platforms in LICs, even while important shifts to LIC ‘ownership’ of research are occurring, further case studies and research are warranted to jointly build better evidence and improve R4D platform setup with ongoing quality improvement.",

LLs with their local participants can become actively constructed subjects in the future instead of passive recipients of aid and development initiatives from outside. The government of Tanzania has recognised LLs as creating resilient communities, however, their role in the national IS is not yet clearly indicated.\nAs Tanzanian LLs illustrate, they shift the development approach from the earlier passive waiting for governmental initiatives to a more active entrepreneurial and technology facilitated approach, even among the most vulnerable participants, namely school dropouts and the unemployed. LLs proactively support positive change with local capability building, employment creation, and empowerment. The focus of the Tanzanian LLs has been on the local communities and need-based solutions to respond to acute everyday challenges. However, the LLs should not become outsourced tools to restore the governmentâ€™s defects and structural barriers related to basic education, social security, and poverty alleviation. \nChallenges exist in developing countries as regards LL policies, dynamics, and knowledge creation. Earlier research and policies are derived from LLs that are technologically advanced, organisationally stabilising or mature, and where the private sector and universities are central. There are conceptual and structural similarities in ISs and LLs around the world, so it is considered attractive in developing countries to create advanced\nLLs for new national ISs, especially in the major urban areas.\n",

      "Key Findings": "The sharing of Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) technology through a web-based platform among Asia-Pacific countries is necessary to equip all parties with all essential technology to mitigate intensifying disasters among others. Among the four types of web-based platforms, the architecture and governance-type platform proved to be the most effective and efficient.",
      "Key Recommendations": "This study identified the barriers why DRR technology sharing is limited in Asia- Pacific countries. The first reason is that disaster-related investment has been motivated by the government sector rather than the private sector. However, the investment priority of most governments for disaster preparedness is of least concern. \n\nTherefore, most disaster-related investment in developing countries have relied on the flow of international aid. \nOnce international funds expire or run out, the beneficiary country is no longer capable of spending money on DRR within its own budget. Second, even though free or inexpensive technology, such as GIS and remote sensing technology, is available and ready for transfer, the enabling technical environment and human capital to apply those technologies are not ready in the beneficiary countries. Finally, the language barrier is an additional source of the difficulty of technology transfer.\nIn addition, four principles have been drawn and recommended: center on end-users’ needs based on usage; focus on problem solving based on content; incorporate inter-activeness by targeting openness and engagement; and provide business opportunities through the commercialization of platform.\nThis paper focusses on DRR technology sharing and transfer in Asia and the Pacific region. However, the methodologies and recommendations of this paper can be applied and extended to the global level for future research.",

      "Key Findings": "The CDF supports evidence-based decisions and so contributes to the development and implementation of new or improved interventions as well as to the translation of innovation, knowledge, solutions, and implementation strategies to policy and practice in addressing development goals and improving health in disease endemic countries.\nFellows identified major bottlenecks for their home institutions and reported whether they were, in their view, addressed by the CDF programme. (57%) estimated that the CDF programme addresses the bottlenecks of home institutions well. \nHome institution representatives stated that the CDF programme led to alleviation of institutional scientific isolation, mainly through the networking aspect of the programme, which facilitates long-lasting relations through post-training communication and collaboration on several levels.\n\nMore than 90% of fellows reported that their competencies in product development or clinical trials were either better (29%) or much better (62%) following their participation in the fellowship. The hands-on experience provided was highly valued. When asked whether they would prefer more theoretical training or more hands-on experience, 76% of the fellows chose the latter.\nIn addition to scientific skills, fellows reported considerable improvement in cross-cutting skills such as (in %): study implementation (90), regulatory issues (90), documentation (86),monitoring & evaluation (81), project planning (81), management and leadership (76), problem- solving (71), quality control (67), ability to acquire new knowledge (62), collaborative practice (62), administration (57), social networking (48), and evidence-based implementation (38).\n\nOverall, the evaluation found the CDF programme to be highly relevant with regard to TDR objectives and the programme’ objectives.",
      "Key Recommendations": "The evaluation highlighted the following general recommendations: \ni) continue and expand the CDF programme, ideally in partnership with other research organisations with similar supporting objectives \nii) develop a reintegration process that includes a re-entry grant scheme, overlapping fellows at host companies, and securing academic credit for programme participation;\n iii) involve home institutions, primarily by better understanding and defining the roles and responsibilities of the different stakeholders in the CDF programme.",

Efforts to promote environmental compliance have been marginally successful as local officials recognize the capacity to stymie regulation and are able to develop mechanisms that address the technological gaps and uncertainties associated with changing technologies, typically with a combination of informational resources and programs that alter the economic incentives for upgrading.\nAt the local level, these cases demonstrate that small enterprises have a host of methods that can be effectively deployed to resist market-altering policies.",

      "Key Findings": "This paper presents an analysis of the ‘anatomy’ of the university in order to identify the salient changes in the institution across time and location in relation to knowledge and relationships with society. A framework is proposed structured around three key dimensions: first, ‘value’—the extent to which knowledge is treated as intrinsically or\ninstrumentally worthwhile; second, ‘function’—the role of the university in terms of storage, transmission, production or application of knowledge; third, ‘interaction’—the flow of ideas and actors between the university and society\"\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "The basic characteristics of the developmental model are the ones most aligned with developmental goals of LMICs, and the best positioned to fulfil the expectations of the post-2015 agenda. There is more than a degree of contradiction then in agencies that endorse the new SDGs but simultaneously promote commodification and unbundling in higher education. Attempts to find solutions that are affordable and efficient are of course laudable, but there is little point in enabling access to higher education for students and safeguarding the viability of the higher education sector as a whole if the overarching purpose and potential for impact of the institution are whittled away.\n\nThe university that will address the post-2015 development agenda may not need to be a state university, at least not in the traditional sense of a fully state-controlled and tax-funded institution. Yet it will need to be a public institution, that is to say, one fully oriented towards the public good. Achieving this aim will require the reversal of a number of explicit policies and de facto trends through lack of policy currently in course around the world.\n",

      "Key Findings": "The mid-term review (MTR) team’s overarching findings are that securing water for food (SWFF) is an innovative and welcome initiative that challenges the funders and awardees alike to think and work differently together. As development cooperation needs new and fresh ideas, more risk-taking, and more systematic and effective inclusion of private actors, SWFF provides a meaningful contribution to the sector. SWFF is being viewed as a positive example of an innovation in itself that aims to contribute to development thinking as well as to practical solutions on the ground. The review team finds that the Founding Partners have not only succeeded in defining goals and focus areas that are relevant but also in blending their various policy objectives in a Grand Challenge. SWFF disposes of strong foundations that constitute an important asset for future action.",
      "Key Recommendations": "At the strategic level, the MTR team suggests that SWFF should continue to contribute to the evolution of the GC model as a key instrument of ODA, reinforce and invest in the SWFF community of practice approach between innovators and with SWFF, work and engage with southern vendors and governments, prioritize funding for innovations that are implemented in water-scarce areas and ensure that some innovations are implemented in countries with low development index and focus on the business model that positively impacts poor and women.\n\nAt the operations and implementation level, SWFF should seek ways to further reduce selection time and the burden of  PAS processes, help identify links to a pool of appropriate investors, and define clear procedures and criteria for the termination of support to awarded innovations.",

      "Key Recommendations": "Going forward USAID should prioritize countries with the greatest opportunities for impact and inclusion.

Treated firms are more likely to switch suppliers and have lower inventory costs, highlighting the importance of cost and supplier information. The benefits are driven by the flow of information rather than a permanent change in practices, as the study shows that the effect fades most among those whose matches dissolve earliest. The study exploits the selection procedure with a regression discontinuity design to show that no observable benefits extend to the more successful, older firm in the match. Finally, the study benchmarks this treatment against a standard microenterprise training program. Training generates changes in business practices covered in the classes but no change in profit, consistent with previous work.",

Through an intensive and iterative process, HELM and its HEI partners developed a comprehensive set of interactive training modules across all four core areas and ARP for professional development beyond the life of the project.\nInvestment in leaders. Perhaps, the most poignant lesson learned from the HELM project was the value of investing in HEI leaders and empowering them to be supportive, collaborative, and effective in their professional roles.\n\nBuilding sustainable peer networks. One of the most sustainable approaches of the HELM project was building communities among higher education professionals. This project approach will be crucial to the sustainability of HELM activities.\n\nNext steps. As RISTEK-DIKTI moves into its new five-year plan starting in 2017, the needle has moved on higher education quality in Indonesia. HEIs have much stronger systems to manage operations and change and better access to tools that can improve their chances for success. Internet technology is growing rapidly, even in Papua, and the digital capacity to store, manage, and generate information will continue to expand with it.",

      "Key Findings": "a. Fertilizer is seen by many as essential if we are going to feed 9 billion people by 2050. There is an opportunity for IFDC to be part of the next “ever-green revolution” by developing and disseminating fertilizer and soil fertility management technologies that are more environmentally sound and more profitable for farmers.\nb. Pursue applied research by agronomists, soil scientists, and economists to develop cost-effective fertilizer products and soil fertility management practices, and work with pluralistic extension systems to extend these best practices to farmers.\nc. Revise the strategy to make applied research programs on a few big questions about fertilizer and soil fertility as the strategy drivers (move away from the projects driving the agenda).",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. The first and recommended scenario is to maintain IFDC uniqueness. The constructive feedback above basically assumes that IFDC would continue its current definition as both a research institution and a project implementing organization, do the necessary rebuilding, and make the changes needed to regain and preserve its uniqueness. But there are other possible scenarios to consider at this time of re-visioning and strategic thinking. The review team has sketched out a few possible scenarios with some pros and cons, but these are by no means exhaustive.\n\n2. A second scenario could be a more radical change. IFDC today has lost much of its research capacity and research funding. At the same time, IFDC has grown and increased capacity as a value-\nchain/agribusiness/markets project design and implementation non-profit organization. One scenario that might evolve from the re-visioning is for IFDC to continue along this growth path and eventually divest itself of most of the research parts of the institution and evolve into a project implementing organization only.\n\n3. A third scenario with significant change could be the reverse of the first scenario above, with IFDC becoming a research institution, divesting itself of investments in projects, and no longer seeking new business to implement new projects. This scenario might include perhaps small action research “pilot projects” that would be testing specific hypotheses, but dissemination of the research products would need to be accomplished through partnerships with other development organizations in the field.",

      "Key Findings": "LEAD alumni are most likely to assume positions of leadership in the private sector in Cairo/Giza and abroad, and less likely to assume positions in the government or in their home governorates. Alumni were still only minimally satisfied with LEAD-managed compared to AUC-managed activities/services. In particular, a missed opportunity for LEAD to provide a better experience for students in two key areas: orientation and student life coordinators. Moreover, Females’ achievements in terms of GPA, LPI scores, and completion rates in the LEAD program were greater than males, with no apparent advantages given to them from LEAD or AUC. Investments in LEAD are worthwhile from a social point of view, given that the IRR is double the social discount rate. Such investments in higher education at other universities would yield a higher IRR, but not necessarily the same employment results regarding employer satisfaction with LEAD alumni’s English, leadership skills, and other soft skills. The AUC has the institutional capacity and commitment to sustain a LEAD-type scholarship program. If donors wish to fund liberal arts education at a top-ranked university, AUC is currently the only option in Egypt. While AUC has limited internal funds for assisting disadvantaged students, they have the capacity to attract external funding for LEAD-type scholarship programs, though perhaps not at the same scale as LEAD.",
      "Key Recommendations": " If USAID prioritizes development of potential leaders in the private sector in Egypt and abroad, future program design may want to consider funding scholarships at universities, such as AUC, where students graduate with strong English language and soft skills that are valued in the private sector. Additionally, future program design may consider funding scholarship programs that keep students connected to Egypt and their communities. In addition to program goals, to achieve greater satisfaction from an AUC scholarship program at a reduced cost, future higher education scholarship initiative designs should consider the following: Full tuition, living allowances, etc., funding for English language training, increasing student life coordinators caseloads, using peer mentors, job training, an orientation program addressing challenges as highlighting opportunities, and a monitoring and evaluation systems (including using student feedback). To achieve gender balance in terms of program outcomes, male students should be monitored to ensure they continue their studies through graduation. If USAID’s concern is a higher return on its investments, restricting its financing to focus on Engineering and Business as opposed to the Humanities and Social Sciences is an option. However, USAID should not be dissuaded from investing in AUC given that the internal rates of return across all programs of study exist. Given that AUC has the commitment, institutional capacity, and potential resources to sustain funding for disadvantaged students, consideration should be given to the extent to which additional funding to AUC is advantageous in advancing USAID/Egypt’s long-term strategy.",

Many scholars, roughly 40% per semester, were placed on Dean’s Honor lists. Four scholars graduated with high distinction and 15 others with distinction. Five scholars received special awards for their excellent achievements.\n\nAll scholars completed the internship component of the program, 24 as professional and civic supplemental (major-related) internships and 26 as non-major internships.\n\nWith respect to the Civic Engagement and Leadership component, all USP II scholars actively attended a variety of workshops, including Leadership Training and Social Media Training Workshops. They all participated regularly in volunteering activities, clubs, and societies. They took part in several field trips. They completed 10 Community Service Projects successfully. For only one of them, the final implementing phase is still pending.\n\nThe number of beneficiaries of these CSPs amounted to about 1000 in their respective communities.\nThe final Performance Monitoring Plan (PMP) indicates equal to or higher achievements than most baseline indicators and Life of Project (LOP) targets, with the exception of a drop noticed in participating in volunteering activities and field trips in the students’ graduation years.",

The commercialization of research undertaken by universities and research institutes is seen as a key element of entrepreneurship. Commercialization of research output, as well as the concept of public versus proprietary science, are differently specified in the agricultural sector (farmers and cooperatives) versus the agro-industry corporations.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Due to the open source aspect of agro-innovation and the appropriation problem, it is for universities to achieve the economies of scale that are needed in becoming entrepreneurial. In order to develop appropriate structural capabilities to facilitate commercialization and organizational strategies that motivate the key actors constituting its core, intellectual capacity should be designed.",

      "Key Findings": "Analyses show that maturity of innovation platforms does not only have to do with the actual platform’s date of establishment. The youngest platform among those studied was the Mukono-Wakiso IP which was only established in 2013. The oldest platform is WeRATE, which started operating as a grouping of NGOs in 2002.\nIPs generally go through several steps of ‘life stages’. Reaching ‘maturity’ may need more or less time depending on the internal dynamics as well as the external environment. For example, the NLA case from Nicaragua needed seven years of activity to reach maturity, whereas the MilkIT platform in India had reached that same life stage after only two years of activity.\nIP outcomes and processes are supposed to provide a basis for outscaling of innovations beyond the original scope, geographical focus or target audience of the IP, as well as the upscaling of innovations to higher (policy) levels where some of the more structural opportunities and institutional constraints for agricultural development can be identified. To explore the potential of IPs in achieving this, we conducted a meta-analysis of mature IPs.\nOur analysis showed pockets of success. IPs that are demand-driven and participatory allow the IP members to work on issues and problems that are relevant for different stakeholder groups. Through their ability to bring together local and scientific knowledge, IPs can guide informed decision-making about which innovations are technologically sound, financially feasible, and politically and socio-culturally acceptable.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "More rigorous, accurate, and continuous measurement of IP performance, which can contribute to adaptive management of IPs, better understanding of 'what works' in terms of process design and facilitation, as well as to cost-benefit analysis of IPs as compared to other approaches that aim to contribute to agricultural development, is required.

      "Key Findings": "Some of the main strengths of the current Irish water research system include:\nWell-established research centres in the water research field; k Highly qualified and experienced water research leaders, including some with extensive experience and strong international reputations; Success in competitive European programmes\n(Horizon 2020, Water JPI); and  Strong established collaboration between national funding agencies.\n\nWhile relatively small in terms of research budget, when compared to other national funders in Ireland (approx. 1.5% in terms of national research budget), the EPA plays, through its research programme, a key role in providing the evidence base for policy\nactions to achieve short- and long-term improvements in the environment, health and economic prosperity, resulting in benefits to society. Key advantages of the EPA Research Programme are\nthat (i) it can rely on and utilise the EPA in-house expertise (other sections of the EPA being the end-users of the research outputs) and (ii) it has built over the years, strong connections with the DHPCLG and with the other funders in the water area.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "Ireland has a high-quality research, technical and scientific base in the water sector but this needs to be further strengthened if we are to address the major environmental and social economic challenges ahead. Technology and innovation have a significant role to play in meeting the environmental challenges and can also deliver economic benefits through enhanced competiveness and improved efficiency.

      "Document Title": "The Role of Science, Technology, Innovation, and Partnerships in the Future of USAID",
      "Key Findings": "USAID possesses three strengths that stand out in the realm of\nSTI+P development: the agency’s on-the-ground understanding of STI+P needs; its convening capability and relationships with host countries to scale STI+P investments; and its ability to learn and adapt to diverse development environments as well as new science and technology.\n\nFirst, through its U.S. and host-country staff, USAID has substan-\ntial on-the-ground knowledge and understanding of the development opportunities and constraints in the countries where it works. After decades of building relationships across societies and institutions, USAID missions, backed by strong technical capabilities in Washington, are in a position to work with country leaders and senior officials of other U.S. government agencies to identify and articulate local development needs and priorities.\n\nSecond, local knowledge and capability enable USAID to catalyze partners and implementers within host countries and among scien-\ntists, engineers, donors, businesses, nongovernmental organizations, and others across a broad spectrum of sectors ranging from agriculture and health to economics and governance. USAID’s imprimatur can help scale advances through such methods as strategic funding, convening diverse partners toward a common goal, leveraging resources, and influencing policies of host governments. Given the increasing importance of scale in measuring successful outcomes, USAID’s strength as a cata-\nlyst can also have important consequences in implementing solutions to social and economic challenges. Free-market mechanisms are needed.\n\nThird, USAID can learn and adapt to diverse development envi-\nronments as well as emerging science and technologies if it applies more broadly the analytical and evaluation tools developed in the last decade. Successful application of science, technology, and innovation rely in all countries on an enabling environment. USAID can use its presence, tools, resources and relationships to help strengthen and sustain that environment. To have greater impact, it will be necessary for STI+P planning and investments to be much more tightly integrated and coordinated across USAID, with leadership and incentives reflecting this integration as a priority at all levels. The Global Development Lab, the technical bureaus, and the administrator’s science advisor are well positioned to serve as conduits to effect this integration, but will need to devote more resources to productive engagement with missions and each other, determining together where the agency has a strategic advantage for innovation and what existing and new tools and inclusive partnerships should be developed to make progress.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Accelerate the transformation of USAID into a global leader and catalyst in applying science, technology, and innovation to developing country challenges, drawing on resources from across the U.S. government, developing countries, the public and private research enterprise, research universities in the U.S. and\nabroad, and bilateral and multilateral development agencies.\n2. Strengthen host countries’ institutional capacity to apply science, technology, and innovation in their own development, as well as to ensure training of individuals in higher education and\nprofessional schools both in-country and in the U.S.\n3. Elevate scaling of successful interventions to be a core USAID\npriority, to expand the impact and improve the sustainability\nand cost-effectiveness of science, technology, and innovation\napplied to development challenges.\n4. Expand investments in science, technology, and innovation that\nengage and empower women.",

      "Key Findings": "Malawi is among the dozen most vulnerable countries globally in\nterms of adverse effects of CC, especially drought, but also floods/heavy rains. Heavy dependence on rain-fed agriculture of both the national and local economies, and for the livelihoods of the majority (85%) rural population makes Malawi particularly vulnerable. Factors including high population density and poverty, small landholding sizes, and the low-input low-output farming\nsystems exacerbate farmers’ vulnerability and reduce the resilience of agricultural systems and adaptive capacity of farming communities to effectively respond to adverse CC impacts or take\nadvantage of emerging opportunities. Understanding the status and shortfalls in knowledge on CC in agriculture provides a baseline for diverse stakeholders to use in enhancing medium- to long-term\nCC adaptation policies, and planning and implementation of sustainable and climate-proofed (maize-based) food-system innovations that enhance yields, food security and incomes for smallholder farmers while also positioning agriculture to contribute to CC mitigation.",
      "Key Recommendations": "More robust research is needed on CC policy and impact analysis, farmer social learning or adoption behavior and effective extension and public education methods. Production of usable climate information and integrating science into climate-related decision making by policy makers and farmers is needed. Participatory research and other methods (e.g., mother-baby trials and farmer field schools) to co-develop and promote adoption of appropriate climate-smart strategies shows promise and needs more focus. Also relatively neglected is research on gender dimensions of CC vulnerability, impacts, and adaptation strategies; livestock and livestock/crop systems, pests and diseases in relation to CC and adaptation; and community-based adaptation. \n\nFinally, major capacity gaps undermine research, policy, and implementation of CC adaptation. They include data availability/quality, human analytical capacity, financial resources and research infrastructure, and institutional support. Human capacity needs for research include modeling (CC projections, crop modeling, mathematical and dynamic modeling, and participatory modeling decision making), geospatial analysis, integrated/interdisciplinary analysis, and core disciplinary training (climate change science, meteorology, and climate change adaptation, social policy analysis and impact evaluation).",

Other programs offer features that are more supportive of face to face collaboration between\nU.S. partner scientists and host country PIs, support to host-country research insitutions, and convenings that bring together researchers with other stakeholders, including polity makers.\nPEER Researchers are satisfied with several elements of the program; a) networking; b) capacity building opportunities; c) NAS support; and d) the grant cycle and proposal process. US partner scientists were measurably less satisfied than PEER PIs.\nPIs gave PEER implementer NAS high praise for responsiveness, engagement, guidance, and flexibility.\nPIs desire improvements in NAS communications in a few key areas: (1) more facetime between PEER PId and US partner scientists; (2) more frequent updates and access to progress reports by USG partner agencies; (3) more frequent and focused engagement with USAID Missions to leverage their support and enhance their understanding of PEER; and more flexibility in choosing mentors beyond those funded by USG agencies.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "Expand the type and number of partnership organizations to the private sector and foundations to offer PIs a wider choice of partners among U.S. Partner Scientists\nPEER funding should include a travel budget for the US Partner Scientists, when needed, to increase face to face interactions between PIs and US. Partner Scientists.\nAugment the size and flexibility of the grants by increasing the ceiling (to $500k), raise limit of purchases of equipment, and extend the life of the project to five years, or allow for more options for no-cost and costed extensions\nTo increase the number of women and you scientists, increase emphasis on mentoring targeted at these groups and address barriers they face during the proposal period and for travel. PEER may consider funding cycles just for women and young scientists.\nProvide a 3-6 post-award planning period to address issues around permits, infrastructure, equipment, procurement, staffing, and other factors with the potential to delay research.\nTo increase engagement of USAID Missions with PEER researchers:\nPrioritize and standardize functions of TDY Supervision trips for NAS and USAID. NAS should focus on supervision of PEER research, while USAID Lab staff focus on improving connectivity between the Lab and Mission staff and to better align PEER research awards with Mission programs and policy dialogue.\nSend staff from Missions with low PEER engagement to Missions with high PEER engagement so they can see the benefits first hand.\n",

      "Document Title": "Responding to global change: A theory of change approach to making agricultural research for development outcome-based",
      "Key Findings": "The theory of change includes monitoring, evaluation, and learning system that combines indicators of progress in research along with indicators of change aimed at understanding the factors that enable or inhibit the behavioral changes that can bring about development impacts. Theory of change represents our best understanding of how engagement and learning can enable change as well as how progress towards outcomes might be measured. Although robust evidence is currently lacking, a theory of change approach appears to have considerable potential to achieve impacts that balance the drive to generate new knowledge in agricultural research with the priorities and urgency of the users and beneficiaries of research results, helping to bridge the gap between knowledge generation and development outcomes.\n\nStrong incentives from funding agencies for a move towards\noutcome-oriented research programs are having a considerable impact on the way in which agricultural research is conceived, planned, implemented, and evaluated. A key requirement for such work is flexibility - the flexibility to adjust so that the outcome orientation works as a support mechanism and enabler rather than a one-size-fits-all straitjacket without space for innovation, serendipity, and creativity. The shift to an AR4D approach based on the theory of change is fostering real transition in the international agricultural research community, much of it for the better in our view. However, it also comes with considerable challenges.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Defining the necessary adjustments, and developing new processes and mechanisms, needs time and resources, which are often grossly underestimated and for which planning is often inadequate. Some of these challenges arise because of the nature of research: the results are not known from the start, in contrast to engineering, for example, where the results are much less uncertain. \nA second challenge lies in striving to balance the need to do great science with the need for impact delivery at scale. A third challenge lies in generating an evidence base that can rigorously address whether and how theory-of-change-based approaches lead to efficiency and effectiveness gains in AR4D compared with other approaches. An evaluation of the outcomes and impacts of\nCCAFS's work is planned for 2020–2021, building in part on revisiting the baselines carried out in the five target regions in 2011–2013\nIn general, this kind of evidence generation will almost certainly involve multi- and trans-disciplinary research that mixes quantitative approaches to measure outcome variables with qualitative approaches that establish the causal mechanisms involved, however difficult this may be in relation to social processes and human behavior. Above all, we need to avoid the focus on outcomes being seen as disadvantageous to science, and development being seen as in competition with the science. Rather, they need to be seen as complementary, enabling, and ultimately liberating.",

      "Key Recommendations": "- USAID should improve its approach to engaging with STI+P capacity in partner countries, through innovative programs. The agency should intensify use of its expanded evaluation methodologies to identify lessons from such programs in creating and sustaining collaborations with developing country researchers and institutions.\n- USAID should bring together STI experts from pillar bureaus, the Lab, missions, and the host countries to share information on available STI resources.  \n- USAID and the Department of State should seek clearer guidance from the White House on technical possibilities for reporting STI+P expenditures. USAID leadership should choose a single option to quantify its STI+P investments and lead an inventory of STI+P-related investments in developing countries across all federal agencies, which would help inform its own and other agencies’ efforts.\n- USAID should set up formal and informal exchanges to strengthen STI+P coordination and share expertise. For example, USAID could establish, through Interagency Personnel Agreements or other mechanisms, a way for USAID staff to have short-term or long-term assignments in other agencies to understand their expertise and constraints.\n- USAID should expand incentives for mission and Washington staff to systematically incorporate science, technology, and innovation approaches as they develop programs and projects. \nCareer development and advancement opportunities should also recognize individual risk taking and initiative around STI.\n- USAID should develop clear guidelines on the intensity of evaluation for each kind of programmatic activity, incorporating appropriate M&E tools that would help project developers to better calibrate their investments with an appropriate balance between cost burden and potential program gains.\n\n",

      "Document Title": "Social network analysis of multi-stakeholder platforms in agricultural research for development: Opportunities and constraints for innovation and scaling",
      "Key Findings": "With regard to the capacity to innovate, the study observed that all three Multi-stakeholder platforms (MSPs) networks are dominated by NGOs with an apparent lack of involvement of the business sector. The dominance of development organizations and lack of entrepreneurial capacity in these networks may hinder social learning and the development of innovations that are commercial and respond to end-user needs. Knowledge plays an important role in the innovation network and the amount of knowledge exchange is positively correlated with the number of collaborative ties an organization has within the innovation network. In DRC and Burundi, the decentralized governance structure seems to create a problem in that MSPs are not strongly linked to the most influential agencies, which could negatively affect their legitimacy and create obstacles for achieving institutional (policy) innovations and upscaling for impact.\n\nThe MSP networks are dominated by supranational and national organizations, whereas local organizations were mostly absent. Such networks are thus less geared towards the outscaling of knowledge-intensive innovation and their local adaptation to diverse end-users and environments. The study illustrates that MSP networks are diverse and context-specific,  propose that MSPs should not be used as blueprint vehicle for supporting innovation and scaling, but that more research is required to understand how the institutional setting (e.g. governance) and under-representation of certain actors (e.g. private sector) affect the ability of MSPs to stimulate capacity to innovate and achieving development impact at scale.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Continuous mapping of MSP networks over time will enable a longitudinal analysis of network evolution and also link it to the actual performance of the MSP with regard to achieving development impacts.\n2. More farmer and business representatives within the MSPT need to be included to ensure that innovation and scaling are more end-user inclusive. \n3. For DRC and Burundi, more attention to developing the knowledge exchange network is necessary in order to connect the different parts of the network (across hierarchies and spatial scales).",

      "Key Findings": "Of the 30 innovations reviewed, 21 are being tested in another country. This does not mean they have necessarily been adopted.5\nHowever, terms such as ‘innovation,’ ‘test,’ ‘proven,’ ‘scaled,’ and ‘transferred’ are not used consistently or clearly defined in practice. This can sometimes create ambiguity in understanding the effectiveness of DO4 activities.\nMost of the innovations transferred are from FSO (six of eight to Kenya and three of three to Malawi) and have not scaled yet or reached a point of sustainability. It is still early in implementation for DO4 activities (less than three years), and all are still in\nthe testing phase. Additionally, innovation promotion within India is qualitatively different from international innovation transfer in that specific additional costs and challenges can arise.\nOffices within USAID/India approach DO4 differently based on their office strategies or mandates, funding requirements, and the existing structures or cultures of their sectors or offices within USAID. Of the innovations examined, certain offices (OSSI, Energy) focused more on innovation testing and scaling within India\n(DO3) than on international transfer (DO4). Whether or how offices are engaging in promoting transfer depends on each office’s mandate, goals, and financing.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Recommendation 3.1. Define DO4 terminology and use\nconsistently throughout the Mission. Many terms pertaining to innovations and innovation transfers are not understood clearly or used consistently. Establishing common definitions of key terms would facilitate communication as well as innovation identification, implementation, measurement, and comparison.\n\nRecommendation 3.2. Expand indirect support for innovation transfer through other approaches. In addition to the project approach, other approaches identified through the evaluation and used within the innovation promotion space include: partnerships (such as Millennium Alliance); market for innovations; grand challenge/crowdsourcing; brokering/matchmaking. Broadening the approach to DO4 would allow various offices to continue to contribute to DO4 but not exclusively through project activities.\nRecommendation 3.3. Coordinate more strategically with other Missions. To increase the likelihood of partner Mission engagement, options include:\nEstablishing innovation partnership goals within partner Mission strategies or project appraisal documents.\nAssigning a point of contact between Missions for DO4 work.\nMarketing to Missions based on their existing sector priorities to build interest an demand.",

The main objective of this EGM was to catalogue the current evidence base around how STIP is used to enhance development programming in L&MICs. The clearest finding from this study is that although a large number of studies are included in the map, they are generally clustered in a few key areas, leaving gaps in large portions of the map. We identify a number of patterns in the evidence: a large number of impact evaluations that evaluate m-health interventions, Outcomes are most commonly measured at the individual or household levels of analysis, the region of the world with the most evidence is Sub-Saharan Africa, where the countries with the most evidence are Kenya and China, followed by India and South Africa. Examining the amount of evidence in each cell of the map, we find several clusters of evidence and several gaps in the evidence: gaps in the evidence on policies and regulation that affect scientific research, access to digital technology, and innovation ecosystems; on a number of science intervention categories, including material and technical assistance for scientific research; on how two-entity partnerships and multi-stakeholder initiatives are implementing development assistance. Conversely, an unsynthesised cluster of evidence around educational programmes to promote STEM; around digital information services such as SMS services, not related to finance or health; and on RBF or PBF programmes’ impact on global health outcomes.",

The second aim of the collaboration is to dig beneath the overall effects to determine exactly\nwhere and how accelerator impacts are influenced by program design choices and ecosystem conditions. Here, we must be wary of generalizing current findings to the full range of accelerator programs and ecosystem conditions across emerging markets.",

      "Key Findings": "Policy Training: The project is advancing steadily in implementing policy training. Needs have been assessed and universities are engaged around developing policies to meet the most complex difficulties identified by the assessment and confirmed by university leaders. \nUniversity Participation: The project reported exceeding its Y1 target for executive leaders trained. In Y2 it is still working towards achieving its annual target. \nPolicy Development: Because policy training is still being implemented and because intended effects are toward long-term changes, it is too early to determine the impact on publication of new, or revision of existing, policies at the partner university level \nEngagement in Training: On an aggregate basis, the project exceeds targets for personnel participation in training on quality academic programming, pedagogy, and curricular innovation. \nCurricular Training: The value placed on curriculum spine training is generally good, though some report challenges in implementation \nQuality Assurance: The initial accreditation results being achieved through the program align with accreditation targets identified in the university partner MOUs. \nWomen in STEM: Universities appear to struggle with some of the university-level Women in STEM obligations they have on the project; therefore, the project is seeking ways to guide partner universities to identify ways to collaborate on campus-level initiatives that will build support for women. \nStudent Engagement: University-private sector collaborations have started to provide opportunities that engage students in national competitions, Women in STEM advocacy, and hands-on learning; however, students at partner universities are largely not aware of BUILD-IT and the opportunities it is providing to faculty. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "Articulate a clear vision for BUILD-IT. Though the implementing partner feels the vision for BUILD-IT is clear, there nonetheless appears to be some inconsistency of understanding among stakeholders of what the project is and is not. \nRefocus the results framework. The framework should flow from a shared vision for the project with its components explicitly integrated to sharpen focus on higher-level results. \nConsider the possibility of focusing the project through a reduction in the number of partner universities. There are universities that are struggling on the project, and it is not fully clear to what extent those struggles emerge from causes solely within the universities themselves, or from the challenges universities face in trying to engage with a project that has so many moving parts. \nBalance top-down and bottom-up capacity building. BUILD-IT provides opportunities for partner universities to develop their capacity around critical areas. However, it falls to the institutions—particularly the leaders of those institutions—to take ownership and create the environment of change. This appears to happen at some institutions, but not at others. \nConsider focusing BUILD-IT on a specific number of academic programs at each institution. There are valid arguments for and against the current broad approach. However, in thinking of systemic capacity building as both a top-down and bottom-up exercise, at the level of individual universities, there is a case to be made for focusing some of the project’s learning-based resources to achieve higher impact across a more defined, narrower range of programs.

      "Key Findings": "The Open AIR partnership is an ongoing initiative. Building on previous successes, the\npartnership has continued to expand following the commitment of the partners to\ncontinue the research initiatives into the future. As new empirical studies get underway\nand the network expands, we can draw a few lessons from the partnership experience\nwithin the framework of the PPP construct.\n\nThe first lessons are that Open AIR demonstrates that PPP categories are not closed.\nIndeed, PPP objectives need to include foundational research that is separated from the\ncurrent focus on access to benefits of knowledge and innovation through products and\nservices deliveries. PPPs remain understudied and, in essence, the relevance of research\npartnerships such as Open AIR lies in their ability to re-imagine and push the envelopes of\nPPPs with slightly different emphasis. As the UN SDGs get underway there is already a\nstrong consciousness for the creation of innovative partnerships toward accountability and\ntheir effective implementation.\n\nCertainly from the Open AIR experience, the boundaries\nof PPPs can be pushed so long as partners have shared goals and objectives and are able to\nThe second lesson from a cross-regional IP and knowledge governance research\npartnership is that such initiative is needed to deeply root PPPs in the development\nagenda. So far, quibbles over the development agenda in IP have built on lingering mistrusts across the developing-developed country geopolitical divide. Those historic\nsuspicions have since engulfed IP and knowledge government institutions, which often\nliterarily walk and work in the delicate balance of these deep-seated crossfires.\n",

      "Key Findings": "EHELD was successful in establishing CoEs at both universities by\n\"updating curricula and developing specialized fields of study, upgrading laboratory equipment and\nresource rooms, providing scholarships to nearly 300 students and 22 faculty members to acquire\ndegrees in target fields, and facilitating 29 CF to teach at the two colleges to enhance quality through\nprovision of new classes and capacity building support for local faculty (LF).\" One of the primary challenges of EHELD was \"the complex relationship\nbetween the implementing partner (IP) and the other various stakeholders, including the two beneficiary universities, as well as the three US-based universities involved as consortium partners.\" The program was successful at building local partners' capacity. Efforts to engage the national government was unsuccessful. The program successfully increase female engagement. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "University recommendations\n-The CoEs are strong assets that should be supported to transition to locally-owned entities, as they work to implement sustainability strategies to maintain their status as premier educational institutions in their select fields.\n-Explore strategies to increase awareness and utilization of valuable CoE resources, such as lab equipment, among relevant partners. Expand the role of the internship coordinator to network with the PS, so that the university can start facilitating support for graduates to find jobs.\n-At the administrative level, institutionalize CoE autonomy to enable the CoEs to generate revenue with USAID-funded assets. Ensure proper oversight of this process to promote revenue distribution according to plan.\nUSAID Recommendations:\n-USAID should continue to fund projects to enhance the quality of Liberian higher education institutions in high-growth sectors. However, future activities should be implemented at institutions with tuition costs that are more affordable to the average Liberian, in order to make intervention more inclusive of economically disadvantaged individuals. \n-Allow a longer implementation period for future curriculum reform projects in higher education. Regularly align work plans across USAID interventions with complementary activities to promote scheduling of inputs in a complementary manner.  Work in close collaboration with all project stakeholders to promote implementation schedules that build off each other in logical and complementary phases. Consider identifying other USAID funding sources to provide the much-needed solar power to protect the EHELD investments.\n",

Outcomes\nand impacts from our work include:\n• Generation of new knowledge and resulting social impact on health, environment, and livelihoods;\n• Leveraged funding and other resources for research and education;\n• Enhanced science teaching and learning with more opportunities for hands-on training; and\n• Improved visibility and reputation of partner departments.\nData collected during the period of the GDA shows that our Instrumental Access model works as\nanticipated; a well-designed, end-to-end model for equipping LMIC university departments does in fact lead to more research, better training, leveraged research resources, and progress towards improved\ndevelopment outcomes. Moreover, the speed with which these outcomes have been observed is\nsignificant. Within 2 years or less of receiving equipment, measurable progress was observed at all of the\npartner institutions studied. Such rapid progress underscores how substantial a barrier lack of access to modern lab equipment is for LMIC scientists. Investments in training, opportunities for networking and collaboration, and physical infrastructure are all important elements of research capacity building, but they are not sufficient to create thriving scientific centers in LMICs without equipment. Even grants designed to facilitate re-entry or support individual research projects are rarely sufficient on their own. A\nhigh level of institutional equipment infrastructure must be put in place for these other investments to pay\ndividends.\n",

      "Document Title": "Open Data in Developing Economies",
      "Key Findings": "We categorized open data’s (intended or realized) impact on development along the following pathways: \nCreating economic opportunity, by enabling business creation, job creation, new forms of innovation, and more generally spurring economic growth \n\nHelping to solve complex public problems by improving situational awareness, bringing a wider range of expertise and knowledge to bear on public problems, and by allowing policymakers, civil society, and citizens to better target interventions and track impact  Improving governance, for instance by introducing new efficiencies into service delivery, and increasing information sharing within government departments \nEmpowering citizens by improving their capacity to make decisions and widen their choices, and by acting as a catalyst for social mobilization \nWe found that there is wide variability of documented evidence. Much of the literature remains focused on the potential of open data to bring about positive benefits — absent real evidence and data. Little distinction is made between intent, implication, and impact, blurring our understanding of what the true value may be of open data. Several of the cas¬es we analyzed did provide evidence that open data had an impact on people’s lives while some failed to achieve notable, scalable impact, or worse, created new harms or risks.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "Despite the variability in evidence, we identified several key take-aways enabling us to make the following specific recommendations for open data practitioners and de-\ncision makers, including donors like USAID, on how to better leverage open data as a new asset for development.\n\nFocus on and define the problem, understand the user, and be aware of local conditions. The most successful open data projects are those that are designed and implemented with keen attention to the nuances of local conditions; have a clear sense of the problem to be solved; and understand the needs of the users and intended beneficiaries. Projects with an overly broad, ill-defined or “fuzzy” problem focus, or those that have not examined the likely users, are less likely to generate the meaningful real-world impacts, regardless\nof funds available. Too often, open data projects have less impact because they are overly data-focused rather than problem- and user-focused.\n\nFocus on readiness, responsiveness, and change management. Implementing open data projects often requires a level of readiness among all stakeholders, as well as a\ncultural transformation, in the way governments and institutions collect, share, and consume information. For development funders, however, this important determi-\nnant of success can imply difficult decisions regarding high-potential open data initiatives in developing economies that lack clear institutional readiness or demonstrated responsiveness to feedback.",

      "Key Findings": "Respondents indicated that an important contribution of the capital assets approach proposed in this study was the value it attributed to the intangible contributions of partners to successful research programmes. They reported that certain components of social and human capitals (for example, local bonds of trust and community cohesion, the strength of traditional decision-making processes and land-based knowledge) that often characterise\nArctic communities in Canada tend not to be recognized as formal contributions to research programmes, unlike the availability of research personnel, infrastructure and equipment.\n\nRespondents also identified some important considerations regarding further development of a capital assets approach to understanding partnerships. First, the concept of natural capital was often understood quite differently by our respondents. For example, assigning elements of natural capital to specific stakeholder groups was fairly clear when it came to established indigenous lands (under treaties, land claims, etc.) but lost much of its relevance beyond this, where boundaries of membership, and ownership were contested, unclear or non-existent.\n\nIn the Canadian context, this often occurs when First Nations have recognised rights on small parcels of land, known as reserves, that may represent small fractions of, or be distant from, their traditional territories.\n\nSecond, respondents reported that our approach was overly simplistic and would require further field development to adequately capture the subtler aspects of social capital.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "Further studies and testing will be needed to adequately refine\na capital assets-based approach to research partnership evaluation and assess its relevance and policy implications with local and regional collaborators in the Canadian Arctic as well as major funding agencies.",

Some staff felt that the Lab had played a role in their understanding of and capacity to use STIP. Staff in both Missions who had taken part in the Lab’s Talent Exchange Fellowship reported an increased understanding of and capacity to use STIP as a result of the fellowship.\n\n2. The Lab’s role in increasing the application of STIP in the Missions’ Program Cycles also varied. At the strategy level, the Lab had more influence in Uganda relative to West Africa Regional.\n3. Other components of the Missions’ Program Cycles experience some increased STIP application.\nThe two Missions (and all operating units across the Agency) do not have separate or specific budget line items for STIP, but this is not a barrier for the application of STIP in the Missions’ projects and activities.\n\n4. Lab services contribute to STIP integration at the project- and activity levels. Various services and resources provided by the GeoCenter, through LWPs and research grants, are the most utilized and have contributed to STIP integration at the project- and activity levels across both Missions.\n5. Lab services with the most value for STIP integration were not specified. Staff at the West Africa Regional Mission did not identify any particular Lab services that had the most value in integrating STIP in the Mission’s work.\n6. A supportive environment in combination with targeted Lab engagement increased STIP integration across the Missions\n\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "Create an online module of the STIP Integration training to make it accessible for Missions\naround the world. Because some Mission staff are not clear about the different components of\nSTIP and how they can incorporate these in their work, the Lab should also request Missions’\nFront Offices to make the STIP integration course compulsory for all staff.\n● Solicit feedback from Mission staff regarding additional specific STIP knowledge gaps. Specifically,\nthe STIP Advisor/Fellow and relationship managers could help gather feedback across\nboth Missions. \n● Examine where GIS expertise might be needed in the Missions to provide additional support\ngiven the high demand for this type of service.\n● Continue hosting a STIP forum annually or bi-annually to share lessons learned and best\npractices around the application of STIP in strategies, projects, and activities.\n\n● Explore the possibility of working with relevant Mission teams to encourage STIP learning via a\nlearning agenda or other mechanisms, such as an internal STIP integration competition, brown\nbags, etc.\n● Explore how the PDO in USAID Missions can obtain a better grasp of the Lab’s services and\nresources, as well as comprehend where they might provide the most value in their Mission’s\nProgram Cycle.\n● Adjust the assessment approach for identifying openings for targeted assistance based on\nMissions’ needs. Specific Lab teams can then determine which Lab resources might address this\nrequest, and offer the Mission options for services based on the Lab team’s resources,\nbandwidth, and expertise, as well as the Mission’s time frame.\n",

      "Key Findings": "The Southern organisations surveyed for this report valued North South research programmes as an opportunity for their researchers to work with new collaborators, gain access to resources and equipment, and for mutually beneficial research around global challenges. Due to the limited funding for research in some regions and the magnitude of socio-economic and developmental challenges, these programmes are seen as of strategic importance in developing research capacity and contributing meaningfully to solve challenges. Programmes that are particularly valued are those that focus on the priorities of the South, recognise the mutual value to both the North and South, emphasise knowledge sharing, Southern leadership, and support improved scientific infrastructure and publication in international journals. Additional reasons for Northern funders include improving development outcomes, for science diplomacy, responding to the internationalisation of science and to work with the best scientists wherever they are in the world.\n\nDespite the wide-range of practices and processes implemented, there are still many challenges that interviewees felt needed to be addressed to fully establish equitable research partnerships in the future.\n\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "Influencing equitable partnership  \n\n1. Inclusive agenda-setting. Working with governments, funders and research communities in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) to develop research programmes that meet their needs. \n\n2.

Setting the tone: Funders can set the tone around expectations of equity within partnerships. \n\n4. Rewarding skilled project managers and team players: Managing diverse research teams that are equitable, culturally-sensitive yet rigorous and impactful requires skills that are under-emphasized in academic training.\n\n5. Looking for equality beyond the leaders: Equity for a wider group engaged with the research including non-academic partners, students, technicians and contractors is important. \n\n6. Equitable budgets, research and financial management. Funders should be consistent in funding allowable to Northern and Southern partners, including for overheads, equipment costs and salary levels. \n\n7. Providing ongoing institutional capacity strengthening: The ability of research organisations to support and manage international research projects plays a major role in whether they are successful.\n\n8. Widening participation. Supporting research partnerships beyond the ‘usual suspects’ requires reaching untapped excellence in LMICs and more proactively building research networks, both North-South and South-South. \n\n9. Investing for the long-term: Trust is a vital component of research collaborations and takes time to build. \n\n10. Working closely with other funders and agencies in the North and South: Improving consistency and join-up amongst funders is needed to simplify application systems and reduce duplication. \n\n\n\n",

      "Key Findings": "Leaders employ the evidence they perceive as most helpful to diagnose problems, set priorities, and design\nor inform implementation strategies\n• Leaders use national statistics and evaluation data most frequently and also found them to be the most helpful\nsources of development data\n• Leaders overall give the nod to qualitative analysis as most helpful by a slim margin, though government officials appear to place a higher premium on impact evaluations\n• Leaders use national level information more frequently than cross-national or subnational information\n• The majority of leaders use information that they discover from in-person interactions, either via formal meetings or informal communications.\nLeaders generally view domestic sources of data and analysis to be quite helpful, but give government agencies the highest marks as information providers\n• The value of non-governmental information is highly context specific: data and analysis produced by local civil society is most helpful in countries with open civic space\n• Leaders put data and analysis from development partners at the top of the class when it comes to the helpfulness of international information sources\n• Not all development partners are equally popular: multilateral organizations command a larger user base for their data and analysis than their bilateral counterparts overall\n• Multilateral organizations with a specific regional or sectoral focus are viewed as the most helpful international information sources\n• Multilateral development partners, the United States, and Germany punch well above their financial weight in terms of attracting domestic uptake of their data and analysis\n \n\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "Our analysis calls attention to 7 strategies, which we will discuss at length in this chapter:\n• Context is key: to capture the attention of leaders, information providers must demonstrate a clear understanding of local realities in LICs and MICs\n• Be constructive: to motivate leaders to take action, information providers should not only diagnose problems, but offer practical policy recommendations\n• Know your niche: leaders expect somewhat different things from domestic and international information providers, which is an opportunity for greater specialization\n• Stand out: to break through the noise, leaders want domestic sources of information to offer new and specific insights\n• Be responsive: leaders want international sources of information to be more aligned with national priorities\n• Co-create with users: involve leaders throughout the process of collecting, interpreting, and disseminating\n",

      "Key Recommendations": "Research must begin at the real farm, through rapid characterization of the target area by cost-effective methods to gain a preliminary insight in the environmental and socio-economic conditions of smallholder farming and its current farming practices. The role of particular crops, animals, practices, and technologies in the farming system must be\nunderstood to address the constraints and interests of the intended clients.\nThe perceptions, drives, and decision-making of farmers must be known, as they will influence eventual adoption. A network of extension agents should guide and support them to test and adapt technologies, and collect data on performance of technologies using simple tools in the form of smart devices.",

      "Key Findings": "A. Seed\nSeed Market: Due to farmers’ longstanding mistrust in the quality of certified seeds, continuing efforts are required in promoting their use in the zone of intervention. The market for certified maize seed is still emerging and is dominated by a single open-pollinated variety in the case of maize; still, opportunities are available for expansion and for the use of hybrids and other varieties that address biotic and abiotic stresses faced by smallholder farmers in the northern regions. The project also was able to demonstrate the suitability of inclusion of other crops into the system to suit different agro-ecological environments. While the project has invested in technologies and infrastructure to increase demand for and use of certified seed, these efforts must be sustained with follow-on activities.\n\nFarmer Uptake: In the past, certified seeds were not typically available in a timely manner due to poor accessibility, with distance as the major constraint, along with poor seed quality issues due to lack of proper seed testing facilities. ATT tackled this by upgrading seed processing and quality control facilities in the region and improved farmer accessibility to quality seeds by introducing mobile seed vans that served as an effective means to bring certified seed to the doorsteps of farmers living in remote\ncommunities.\n\nB. Soil\nSoil Testing: ATT realized that farm-level soil testing supported by nutrient management decision support tools often resulted in higher yields. Yet, there is a need to develop such capacities in the region, particularly to enable extensive soil mapping that includes secondary and micronutrients in addition to major nutrients (N, P, K), that should be supported by specific crop-level fertilizer recommendations. Infrastructure is needed in terms of either establishing new soil testing labs or upgrading existing facilities with new technology and tools. \n\nUDP: Time-lapse photography from drone-based research has shown that rice fields using UDP application attained faster growth and maturity and also resulted in higher yields compared to non-UDP field plots. Despite these benefits, inadequate access to briquetting machines remains a constraint to farmer uptake of this technology at a larger scale.",
      "Key Recommendations": "A. Seed\nFor measurable impact or transformation, interventions must target the whole system, along with its actors, rather than just one\naspect of the value chain. For example, promoting the use of certified seed must not only focus on the users; it must start with\nresearchers and breeding agencies.\nThrough infrastructure and logistics support to research and regulatory institutions, ATT removed bottlenecks in the development and release of certified seeds. The foundation has been set for these institutions to provide enhanced seed varietal development, release, and inspection services, but continuing efforts are needed to further increase their effectiveness and efficiency.\nIn addition, the Seed Inspection Division of MOFA should be decentralized and resourced to strengthen the monitoring functions at the divisional level.\nATT enhanced the capacity of local seed companies and LIPs to distribute seeds to last-mile customers using mobile seed vans and trained community sales agents. These efforts increased farmers’ access, built farmer demand, and strengthened business for local companies. More vans are needed to further assist retailers to travel to hard-to-reach communities. This can be enabled by designing proper financing mechanisms through innovative partnerships. Moreover, additional seed laboratories at the district level could reduce transportation costs for seed producers and LIPs.",

      "Key Findings": "Our work on poverty dynamics has established three fundamental and complementary pathways into and out of poverty: assets, capacities and risk. Our field trials around the world have contributed significantly to our understanding of these dynamics and provided the opportunity to design and evaluate programs intended to reduce poverty and promote resilience.\nIn the broadest sense, ending the need for development aid will depend on our ability to continually shrink the number of poor households over time. While cash transfers sustain the very poorest households in times of dire need, we could achieve much bigger long-term impacts from a contingent transfer—such as agricultural insurance—that keeps vulnerable households from falling into poverty. This phenomenon, which we have called the “social protection paradox,” presents a real opportunity for promoting resilience when scaled to national social protection budgets, particularly for countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and others that face a growing threat of weather-related shocks.\nWhile the policy focus is often on assets, research shows that stress, depression or a deterioration in physical health can affect cognitive function, resulting in hardship that itself reinforces stress and depression. In the development context, this kind of self-reinforcing loop—effectively a behavioral poverty trap—means\nthat the experience of poverty itself can influence an individual’s future decisions about productivity.\n",

      "Key Findings": "The project has established a “before” and “after” legacy in Ghana’s agricultural political economy through the project’s multiple interventions. These interventions assisted counterparts with creating an evidence-based agriculture policymaking process that incorporates inputs from researchers and the private sector, including civil society and the media. Some of these legacies are summarized below.\n\nThe project built the Ministry of Food and Agriculture’s capacity to identify, develop, analyze, and implement agriculture policies that are supported by empirical analysis. Ministry staff now provide timely policy advice to ministry key decision-makers.\n\nThe local research community, comprising major public universities and think tanks, increased their research capacities with project support and developed a set of evidence-based policy research studies to make significant adjustments to Ghana’s agriculture policies and programs. The Ministry of Food and\nAgriculture is committed to incorporating recommendations as part of their policymaking process.\n\nResearch efforts resulted in mutual respect and ongoing engagement between researchers and the public sector to ensure a continued flow of knowledge into the policymaking process. Researchers and the ministry will continue the Agriculture Research Summit annually as an example to sustain their collaboration.\n\nPrivate sector stakeholders, with project support, are now better prepared and motivated to engage with the public sector in meaningful discussions to strengthen food security and work toward an enabling environment to promote private sector investments in Ghana’s food industry. NASTAG, NETRIGHT,\nHAG, and the media — all critical players for agriculture policy advocacy — are continuing to convene and strengthen public-private dialogue.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Maintain momentum of reforms advanced by the project; \nScale up project-initiated pilot initiatives including private accreditation of seed enterprises to conduct seed certification implementation of quality management procedures for high quality seed production, and expansion of seed licensing agreements; and \nSolidify public and private sectors roles in developing quality, certified seed production and uptake in Ghana. \n",

With the understanding that, in general the community is currently underfunded and in consequence cannon support the needs of the sector, it is our recommendation that the first and important step in developing long-term strategy for increasing, organizing and supporting financially the research on cacao in Colombia will be the establishment and funding of the proposed permanent CRC working group that will provide leadership and advocacy, and will set common priorities and support the needs of the cacao research community in Colombia. More detailed proposal needs to be develop and offered for consideration to potential funding agencies including Colombian Ministry of Agriculture, USAID, USDA-FAS and others.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Key Recommendations are to development a 5-year, 10-year and future vision plans with specific research priorities and global needs assessment to consolidate and integrate the many prior assessments. Also, work with the existing national and international structure reviewed above to develop coordinated funding nodes and specific programs at each level of the cacao value chain for research to reduce redundancy, increase focus on priority topics and foster interdisciplinary research. Development of a coordinated framework for funding the nodes to consolidate funding to fewer, larger programs with coordinated priority areas. Development of standardized system for research proposal evaluation (peer review system) to increase the quality and impact of funded research programs and involve more scientists in the community. Development of coordinated program for capacity building to be implemented within the research programs to increase scientific capacity and train next generation of scientists. Build the competitiveness the Colombian cacao research community to compete for national and international research funding by: Building a sustainable research network supported by network manager and knowledge sharing platform. Providing the members of the network with access to information related to advances in research in the field of cacao research and in general. Providing the members of the network information with a database with members information useful for connecting with potential partners. Providing the members of the network on a regular base with information related to new funding opportunities Providing the members of the network with guidance and support for preparation of grant proposals including consultation, resources and training to build teams, and technical guidance for timely proposal writing and according to guidelines. Develop community tools and resources that will accelerate cacao research such as genetic databases, communication tools etc.",

      "Document Title": "Developing a local innovation ecosystem through a university-coordinated innovation platform: The University of Fort Hare",
      "Key Findings": "It can be concluded that ensuring a greater developmental role for the UFH includes a number of changes on the institutional as well as infrastructural level. The development pathway approach was unpacked to describe efforts by the university to create an institutional environment conducive to a development role. In particular, drivers that affect the university’s form and focus of functions, and changes in the form and focus of the three missions were considered.\n\nFlowing from the development pathway discussion (institutional level changes) the author explored a platform intervention that is being implemented by the UFH. Here a new and diverse range of actors are engaged through the platform in order to contribute to a wider range of experiences, perspectives, histories and expectations. This contributes to the creation of spaces for engagement, collective experimentation and capacity development. It creates a mechanism through which the UFH and regional stakeholders may discuss needs and possibly incubate ideas.",
      "Key Recommendations": "The effective and successful implementation of the suggested infrastructures depend wholly on its acceptance and implementation on an institutional level. This requires a change in the disengaged science model of the past decade. Of crucial importance is that the sustainability of the platform is dependent on resourcing both soft and hard, as well as learning from and sharing of tangible results and outcomes to be reached. This entails the development of monitoring and evaluation infrastructures and the sharing of success stories through appropriate channels.\n\nFinally, constructive and productive collaborations can only be achieved through ensuring formal and informal engagement processes which are largely dependent on the development of appropriate capabilities in all actors.\nFuture research efforts may include a more detailed unpacking of development pathway factors and how those relate to infrastructural innovations such as intermediary platforms. Although the role of innovation platforms in the concertation and coordination of the innovation ecosystem have been explored in business context, its application in university context remains sparse – an idea for future research.",

      "Key Findings": "The PMIL research program was organized around three primary themes: 1) genomics and breeding, 2) aflatoxin detection and nutrition, and 3) research along the peanut value chain.\n\nGenomics and breeding:\nAs part of a larger collaborative initiative in the peanut research community, geneticist Peggy Ozias- Akins and partners advanced the development of a SNP chip genetic marker system and evaluated the potential for this tool to identify genetic associations with aflatoxin resistance in targeted populations in both the US and with partners in Senegal. \nWith joint funding from the USAID’s Norman Borlaug Commemorative Research Initiative, research pathologist Renee Arias and colleagues developed an innovative potential strategy for aflatoxin control through an RNA interference strategy targeting the toxin-producing Aspergillus flavus molds as they infect the peanut plant before they are able to produce the toxin. \nThe Integrated Global Breeding Program achievements include assistance in the release of several improved varieties in the US and overseas, establishment of a new breeding program in Haiti, initiating an innovative network of young breeders in several national programs in Africa who are now sharing technology and varieties, as well as collaborating on broader regional research objectives.\n\nAflatoxin detection and nutrition:\nEach of the four projects under the detection and nutrition theme was unique, but collectively are important steps towards measuring aflatoxin and its impact, and eventually to the improvement of the nutritional status of people in targeted countries, especially women and children. Haibo Yao’s team at the US Department of Agriculture advanced their innovative spectral imaging strategy for low-cost aflatoxin detection, completing a prototype of the “aflabox” while also exploring new areas where this technology may be disruptive in low-cost monitoring of aflatoxin in maize.\nJS Wang’s lab at the University of Georgia was able to develop a method to use dried blood spots to detect aflatoxin exposure in human blood. \nKumar Mallikarjunan’s investigation of various detection methods and labs was able to confirm the detection limits of some novel technologies, as well as some potential issues with human error in accurate detection.\nFinally, while pediatrician Mark Manary’s study of a new Ready to Use food for malnourished mothers in Malawi was unable to produce significant birth outcomes as hoped, it did advance the knowledge of the treatment window for this important population.\n\nResearch along the peanut value chain:\nThe three large value chain projects varied greatly depending on the needs and opportunities in each country. Though different in structure, the randomized control trial in Ghana also advanced the knowledge of aflatoxin control measures in the value chain in Ghana.\n\n\nCapacity Building:\nMore than 70 students received graduate degrees in a range of disciplines related to agronomy, food science, nutrition, or public health with PMIL support. Of those students, 53 studied at universities in their home country or region, further building higher education capacity within their university systems. Half of the graduate students were female. In addition to long-term training, the PMIL provided short-term training to 48 students.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Further study and understanding is needed on the generation, persistence, movement and\nconcentration of small RNAs being produced inside peanut plants.\nThe development of RNAi-transformation in countries that are GMO (genetically-modified organism)-friendly should be continued in order to provide “safer” peanut seeds for human consumption. This work will continue in collaboration between NPRL and Kenyatta University, Kenya, beyond the termination of the PMIL project.\nThe “workflow” for genetic diversity of Aspergillus should be applied to areas of the world where aflatoxin contamination is a health threat.\nLessons Learned and Changes Made in Project Objectives\nThere is a great need for the transfer of skills, from simple technologies to help farmers in Sub- Sahara African countries, to current laboratory tools to build the next generation of scientists in\nthose countries.\nInvesting even short time in providing training to foreign students can have a significant impact in their careers and their countries. \n",

      "Document Title": "Sustainable Higher Education Research Alliances (SHERA): Baseline Study Report",
      "Key Findings": "Overall, most CCRs scored in the low-middle range (score of 2), meaning that they have some knowledge and experience with partnerships, collaborative research and activities included in SHERA’s results framework. However, it would tell a slightly different picture if looking at the following three indicatorswhere SHERA uses as the basis for baseline survey data collection and analysis, 1) partnership capacity; 2) collaborative research capacity; and 3) where do CCRs stand on SHERA’s results framework. \n\nIn partnership capacity, ITB and Universitas Indonesia (UI) have the most experience partnering in collaborative activities with other Indonesia-based HEIs, while Institut Pertanian Bogor (IPB) and UI have the most experience in working with U.S.-based HEIs in a similar capacity. \n\nIn general, the affiliates reported having minimal understanding of their CCR’s purpose, as well as the reporting and accountability process. Most of the responses provided were clearly their best guesses or ideals related to what a CCR should be, as opposed to clear and realistic statements of what their CCRs are based on their knowledge.\n\nIn collaborative research capacity, IPB and UGM scored the highest among the five Lead CCRs. Specifically, both institutions noted easy access to research methods courses. Compared to other Lead CCRs, both also cited a high-level of confidence in their staff members’ English language ability, as well as their institutions’ efforts to include women scholars in research activities. \nIn addition, there are affiliate members who have sufficient IT-capacity, staff who comfortably speak English, and offer research methods courses at their institutions. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "The findings from the baseline study resulted in a recommendation from SHERA on the target setting for SHERA’s results framework through project completion. SHERA experienced a delay in producing the recommendations due to the CCR’s own delay in aligning their work plans within the project’s monitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework. SHERA has diligently worked with each CCR on their work plan and targets per performance indicator, which is critical to achieving the intended outcomes. At the end of the process, SHERA believes that the targets proposed by the CCRs were overly ambitious in some areas, and SHERA continues to work with them to identify increasingly realistic targets.

      "Key Findings": "Concerning research outcomes, both ILs have met or exceeded many of their initial goals. In\nsome cases, the programs have had to adjust in the face of unforeseeable difficulties or\nchanging circumstances and opportunities. The adjustments have been adopted after proper\nconsultation and likely enhance the long-term impact of the labs. Both lab directors have been\nreasonably nimble in adapting to changes and challenges.\n\nThe AWGIL and the CRCIL have faced at least two common challenges in their research\nprograms. In both cases the capacity to create data seems to exceed the capacity to manage\nthose data and optimize their value to the program and to other scientists. This situation\nreflects a broad issue in the scientific community today, and it is a significant challenge to the\nwork conducted in these ILs.\n\nConsistent with the priorities of USAID, the AWGIL and the CRCIL have attempted to be gender-sensitive in their research activities. The nature of the research leaves little scope for engagement with women as users of the final technologies or in systems that might reach the\nfarm level. Therefore, the primary mechanism whereby these labs can engage women is\nthrough capacity building of female scientists. The underrepresentation of women in science,\nparticularly in agricultural sciences, in the target countries has made it difficult for both ILs to\nidentify and recruit highly qualified women into their degree training programs. The AWGIL\nand CRCIL made thoughtful efforts to recruit women. While both ILs had and met overall\nquantitative targets for trainees, establishment and ongoing management of gender targets\nbetween USAID and IL leadership was inconsistent.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "The two labs reviewed here have made significant advances in accordance with the initial\nproposals. Achieving the development impacts on smallholder farmers that USAID seeks will\nrequire considerably more time and continued efforts along the lines that each IL has been\npursuing. The EET recommends that future activities emphasize:\n1. Data management and software systems to ensure optimal use of the resources\ndeveloped under the ILs.\n2. Increased efforts to engage partners from South Asia in degree training and in the use of\nGenomic-Estimated Breeding Value (GEBV) modeling for Genomic Selection (GS) in\norder to achieve lasting impact in wheat.\n3. Efforts to leverage new chickpea resources developed over the last five years to move\nfrom pre-breeding to breeding activities.\n4. Establishment of mechanisms for systematic assessment of learning outcomes from\ntraining efforts, especially short-term training activities.\n5. Careful consideration of the optimal distribution of funding for administrative personnel\nand scientific personnel if a program attempts to move chickpea activities from pre-\nbreeding to breeding.",

      "Key Findings": "The impact of CDD programs:\nCDD programs improve facilities for education, health, and water. Investments in water-related infrastructure have reduced the time required for collecting water. These programs slightly improve health- and water-related outcomes, but not education outcomes.\n\nCommunity participation in CDD programs:\nThe entire community does not participate in all aspects of project management and implementation. There is a clear funnel of attrition. Many people may be aware of the program and the community meeting, but few attend the meeting and fewer still speak or participate in decision-making. Women are only half as likely as men to be aware of CDD programs, even less likely to attend the community meetings, and even less likely still to speak at them. Evidence suggests people may have participated in making bricks, not decisions.\n\nCDD programs may be using existing social cohesion rather than building it. Numerous factors may affect community involvement, such as the role played by the elite or prime movers in the community, intra-community divisions, and the perceived benefits of participation.\n\nParticipation of marginalized people: Although CDD programs have included measures to improve the participation of marginalized people, there is no evidence regarding the impact of such measures. There is also no information about how program implementers facilitated the participation of different ethnic and religious groups living in a community.\n\nGendered cultural norms and socioeconomic factors can negatively influence women’s participation in the public sphere. Where female participation is a target, not a requirement, women’s participation usually falls short.\n\nNot many studies have carried out sex-disaggregated analysis of participation. Fewer still have assessed whether CDD programmes have empowered women to take a more active role in the public sphere, beyond the scope of the programme.",
      "Key Recommendations": "It may be better to abandon the CDD programme objective of building social cohesion and focus instead on sustainable, cost-effective delivery of small-scale infrastructure. Programme implementers need to assess if community members are willing or able to make contributions to development projects. Moving beyond the definition of a community as a geographical administrative unit and considering different groups and gendered power relations in the community would be important for delivering more equitable programmes.",

      "Document Title": "Who benefits from which agricultural research-for-development technologies? Evidence from farm household poverty analysis in Central Africa",
      "Key Findings": "The findings demonstrate that adoption of AR4D technologies reduced rural poverty by about 13 percentage points from an average of about 60% of poor adopters. A large share of this poverty reduction was attributed to adoption of improved crop varieties (32%) followed by postharvest technologies (28%), while adoption of crop and natural resource management (CNRM) technologies contributed 26% with the rest (14%) being attributed to unmeasured factors. These findings reflect two interesting policy propositions:\nFirst, designing program interventions that can support easy access to postharvest technologies along with affordable, improved seeds can accelerate the rate at which rural households can move out of poverty, suggesting that efforts to out-scale CIALCA technologies are essential for sustained poverty reduction. Second, the skewed conviction by donors and policy makers of disproportionately allocating resources based on easy-to-measure impacts associated with certain technologies needs to be re-evaluated.\nOur findings show that the impact on poverty reduction attributable to adoption of postharvest technologies is nearly equal to the impact attributable to adoption of improved crop varieties. However, without improved crop varieties and CNRM technologies, the impacts attributable to postharvest technologies are limited and/or not sustainable.\nThe findings from our sample of households in Central Africa further show that adoption of different components of AR4D technologies have varying impacts on poverty reduction. Clearly, the relatively poor farm households make high productivity gains from adopting improved seeds that are more likely to enable them to move out of poverty or improve their expenditure power towards the poverty line\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "The findings emphasize that effective interventions to reduce rural poverty require a selective–stepwise technology intervention based on household income distribution.\nParticularly, an intervention process beginning with disseminating productivity improving technologies (affordable improved seeds complemented with affordable crop and natural resource management technologies) and gradually evolving into creating an enabling environment for enhancing or inducing agricultural commercialization, not only leads to faster rural poverty reduction but also has high potential for agricultural transformation. \n\nHowever, our study does not determine the optimum point at which the adoption rate of productivity improving interventions would require the introduction of an enabling environment for inducing agricultural commercialization, an area for future research. Also measuring poverty reduction attributable to individual AR4D institutions is equally an important area of future research.",

      "Key Recommendations": "GIP-IL project implementers should conduct a detailed assessment of existing capacity and built-in some flexibility in order\nto develop a comprehensive and practical implementation schedule.\n\nProject implementers should use the management and research metrics developed at the start of the project to measure\nall aspects of the project on an ongoing basis.\n\nProject implementers should, if allocated more time and investment, prioritize the research objectives that remain to be\nmet and develop a clear implementation plan.\n\nThe GIP-IL program should stay focused on completing the discovery phase of work, and carefully design and use the low-\ndensity SNP panel.\n\nTo attain significant, long-term, improved NDV and heat stress resistance chickens, future GIP-IL efforts must focus on\nsustainably developing the validated and improved breeding stocks.\n\nProject implementers need to conduct several more years of research and produce multiple generations to show\nsustainable effects.\n\nAll relevant stakeholders should continue to examine the advantages and disadvantages of natural exposure and controlled\nexposure for completing Objective 2.\n\nPoultry value chain research should include increased participation of farmers and other community stakeholders, including\nwomen, to ensure sustainability.\n\nManagement and research team members should review the existing information sharing guidelines to ensure all\nparticipants are up-to-date on the research metrics collected and recorded.\n\nAdditional time should be allowed in order to complete validation and distribution of chickens for breeding. In order to\nmeet GIP-IL’s goal of developing chickens with enhanced NDV and heat resistance, funding will need to be extended.",

      "Key Findings": "Collaboration between entities is fundamental for grassroots organizations to achieve their mission. In this paper we presented two instances of how these collaborations can unfold. Our goal is to provide insight into what advantages and challenges engaging in multilateral partnerships may bring for these initiatives, and most importantly, for grassroots organizations leading these efforts. From our perspective, generating a flexible framework for negotiating and aligning objectives, making sure that principles and philosophies across partners are compatible and acknowledging the limitations some partners may have due to political or organizational factors, are key aspects to the design of these alliances. Having a structure for measuring impact that is shared among all organizations can help understand in detail how these partnerships add value or disrupt the achievement of each partner’s mission. Expanding the Theory of Change framework to include input from all organizations is a logical step. Recently, numerous groups working in the field of International Development are using this strategy with promising results (Vogel, 2012). Partnerships also provide a unique opportunity to shift structures and systems by exposing stakeholders to new approaches, methodologies and philosophies of work. The fact that each organization brings to the table networks, knowledge and resources, represents an advantage when trying to capitalize these opportunities. We hope to demonstrate that, if carefully crafted, these kind of partnerships can be powerful tools for achievement and change across partners objectives and systems.",

      "Document Title": "How does the context of research influence the use of educational research in policy-making and practice?",
      "Key Findings": "The results reveal that research utilisation is a complex process, and the participants recognised that a series of variables can have great impact on their work. Tailoring research to users, the existence of funding and other resources, mechanism of access to beneficiaries and collaboration are all critical to pushing research up and out of the university context.\n\nIn the first place, the study identifies who are the perceived users of educational research and reveals the students as main beneficiaries, together to school teachers and colleagues from academia. Research is produced and delivered to students; this insight can help us understand the context of research production in Romania, which is centred on a model of academia that\nprioritises teaching as a university mission. \nSecondly, the study focuses on the factors influencing the research use, among which the access of resources and funding appear as critical issues. As in other national contexts, in Romania, the main sources of funding are the national government and public European funds. \n\nThirdly, the study identifies the role of research collaborative communities to foster the research uptake in practice. Academics perceive benefits for academic progress and social benefits in terms of social contribution. Research partnerships represent a key point for academic researchers, and these partnerships are seen by researchers as opportunities to enhance their own results and to close the gap between theory and practice. \nThis position allows us to consider partnerships between researchers, policy makers and practitioners as a priority for any educational reform agenda.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "This study has implications for higher education institutions, policy makers and practitioners as users who are engaged with research. First, research producers, such as higher education institutions, must adopt research as part of their mission and priority, promoting institutional measures and organisational cultures that support research and users’ priorities.\n\nThe research culture in the Romanian higher education system remains in transition from teaching-based values to research-intensive environments. Second, to succeed, initial and continuous training with a strong research component are required. Academics must understand the priorities of policy makers and practitioners and craft their research accordingly.\n\nThis process draws attention to the professional identity of academics and shifts their work paradigm from teaching to teaching and research; alternatively, it includes only research intensive profiles.\n\nTranslating educational research is a complex process and requires a balance between researchers’ own research and disciplinary interests and the agendas of policy makers and practitioners. Harmonising these two contexts is difficult and, as Levin (2011) recognised, translation activities are sometimes poorly understood in the academic social sciences. In parallel with research-production actions, policy makers and practitioners must provide researchers with opportunities for interaction, knowing that their partnership is crucial for influencing policy and practice within the educational field. Strategic dialogue between research production and research use is still needed to overcome these barriers.",

      "Key Findings": "Partnership experience: The partnership experience has been largely positive for both Pakistani and U.S. universities. Affiliation with U.S. universities has elevated the prestige of the Pakistani universities, and the partnerships have been instrumental in building the centers’ capacities in curriculum, applied research capacity, and sector engagement. On the U.S. side, partnerships have enabled U.S. faculty and students to understand sector-related issues from a Pakistani perspective and helped U.S. universities recruit students. Challenges to the partnerships have included aligning the partners’ priorities to achieve lasting change.\n\nEffectiveness of components: The project encompasses multiple components:\n\nForeign exchanges: International exchanges have been transformative in enhancing students’ research capacity and developing professional focus. Faculty exchanges have been less popular, initially due to poor planning, but also because prolonged travel can be difficult for faculty.\n\nApplied/joint research: Each CAS pursues applied research in a manner that best serves its needs. For NUST and UETP, this has meant awarding grants to both CAS faculty and outside experts, while MUET focuses on developing internal capacity around a defined research agenda. Potential clients/collaborators\nin the sector vary in their satisfaction with CAS research; MUET-associated organizations are very satisfied, NUST organizations are less so, and UETP organizations see potential but have not seen\nresults.\n\nLab utilization: Each CAS developed high-quality research labs specific to sector needs. Procurement challenges caused extensive delays in operationalizing labs, and now each center is developing utilization strategies to guide student and faculty use, as well as commercialization.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Strengthen industry-academic linkages to foster a better understanding of industry problems and commercialization of CAS/NUST resources: CAS/NUST should deploy its faculty to identify the needs of specific organizations and to design solutions. Moreover, as it strategizes its outreach and relationship development, CAS/NUST should engage high-level energy-sector professionals on its corporate advisory board to advise the center. The center should also engage the University Office of Research, Innovation, and Commercialization (ORIC) and HEC to help build stronger relationships with sector organizations.\n\nDevelop comprehensive marketing and outreach efforts: CAS/NUST should establish a dedicated marketing and outreach unit to design and implement a comprehensive strategy to analyze market needs\nand to develop messaging across multiple sector segments. The strategy should address the market for CAS consulting, training, lab testing, applied research, and career placement of students. The unit should also dedicate resources to focus exclusively on a strategy for developing and procuring funding from domestic and international donors.\n\nEstablish a technology center to offer short-term training courses and energy audits: CAS/NUST should work with USAID and HEC to produce a comprehensive business plan for a technology center\nthat defines realistic market analyses, resources, revenue potential, seed funding sources, and the time horizon needed to achieve sustainability. Once the center is established, NUST can leverage faculty expertise to provide skills-based, short-term training using center resources as a means of generating revenue. However, the readiness of faculty to deliver such training is a prerequisite for such an endeavor.",

      "Document Title": "Marshallian Forces and Governance Externalities: Location Effects on Contractual Safeguards in Research and Development Alliances",
      "Key Findings": "The study findings show that when partnership activities are located in regions with greater knowledge spillovers and R&D competition, partners are more likely to craft formal contractual safeguards and procedures to support their collaborative agreements. This result is consistent with previous findings that competitive conditions that escalate the potential losses from spillovers and imitation might cast a shadow on firms’ location and sourcing choices\n\nAlthough we do not address the location choice question, our findings are broadly in accord with the argument that firms operating in a cluster safeguard their knowledge by how they organize their knowledge creating activities.\n\nSecond, the study teases out two related sources of personal interactions that contribute to governance externalities when partnership activities are located in a cluster. We find that the greater the employment density of individuals in the focal industry, the lower is the likelihood of formal contractual procedures to deal with adaptation. \n\nThird, the study provides evidence that greater intensity of professional association membership also reduces the incidence of formal governance mechanisms. Institutions with greater presence in a region might not only facilitate the development of strong linkages among professionals in a sector but also promote common norms that enable social ordering and help mitigate transactional adaptation concerns.\nFinally, our evidence of negative relationships between formal governance mechanisms and employment density as well as the thickness of institutional relationships suggests that firms treat the relational governance features of agglomeration as a substitute for formal contractual provisions.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "Future research may also examine how the structuring of external corporate activities potentially mediates the relationship between agglomeration and performance, a continuing theme of agglomeration studies. The performance of firms may not be limited to traditional metrics, such as long term financial performance, but may also include innovative outcomes and new product launches. Future research can examine the implications of agglomeration externalities for how buyers and suppliers structure their linkages for enhancing joint value creation.",

      "Document Title": "Integrating impact evaluation and implementation research to accelerate evidence-informed action",
      "Key Findings": "In this paper, we argue that impact evaluations and implementation research produce\ndifferent types of equally necessary information for evidence-informed action, and that\nincorporating research questions and study designs from impact evaluation and\nimplementation research will improve evidence for both types of studies and strengthen\nprogram evaluation. Adding more explicit assessments of implementation outcomes\nalong the causal pathway, more rigorous methods to do so, and specifics of how and\nhow well interventions are implemented will improve the usefulness and generalizability\nof both types of research. We believe prospectively embedding evaluation and\nmeasurement in the implementation process is a more robust approach – and probably\nmore efficient, although not quicker – for producing the desired information for evidence-\ninformed action. We focus on research in health, as this is the field from which\nimplementation science, and thus implementation research, emerged. However, the\nsame argument can be made for improving evidence in other sectors, since most\nprograms are at least partially dependent upon how well they are implemented.\n\nWe propose an approach to integrating impact evaluation and implementation research\nthat incorporates the explicit recognition and rigorous measurement and assessment of\nmediators and outcomes from implementation research into the theory of change used\nfor impact evaluation. This framework adopts several elements more commonly used in\nimplementation research, including process evaluation of implementation moderators, a\ntheory of change about the behavior of individuals and organizations implementing the\nintervention, measurement and reporting of adherence to content and dose, and\nstandardized reporting of the intervention sufficient for replication. Greater rigor in\nmeasuring implementation is adopted from impact evaluation. Evaluation of both\nimplementation and beneficiary outcomes can use experimental or quasi-experimental\ndesigns.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Add research questions about the key elements of the implementation approach to\nimpact evaluations. The inclusion of research questions regarding implementation in\nimpact evaluations will stimulate and structure measurement of implementation\noutcomes, in addition to beneficiary outcomes. Some of the missed opportunities to\nmeasure implementation in the first case study were due to the limits set by the grant\nprogram, which determined the focus on beneficiary outcomes. In the second case\nstudy, the analysis of additional factors suggested by the embedded qualitative\nimplementation research provided important insights into the successes and\nshortcomings of the implementation approach. In the third case study, an objective from\nthe outset was to design a patient-focused intervention. Consequently, the evaluators\nbuilt in extensive implementation research to understand how the intervention was\ndelivered and received.\n\nInclude causal chain analysis about expected changes in professional behavior,\norganizational structures and relationships among stakeholders in impact evaluations to\nassess fidelity and appropriateness. The expected causal chain for achieving\nimplementation was articulated in both 3ie studies, but there was insufficient\nmeasurement along the pathway or outcomes. Although some qualitative data provided\ninformation about fidelity and additional moderators of appointment and treatment\nadherence, a more iterative approach could have addressed some of the new factors.\nStronger attention to process indicators along the causal pathway could have provided\nmore rigorous evidence about fidelity of implementation. In part, this is a result of the\nlack of research questions about the implementation approach. In the second case\nstudy, the initial questions were primarily about implementation, and there were iterative\nresearch activities to understand changes in organizational structures and relationships\namong stakeholders. Once the model had been adapted on the basis of the\nimplementation research, the impact evaluation was conducted.",

      "Key Findings": "From the study, 59% (35 out of 59) farmers saw their yields increase over the period the innovation was active in Mozambique. All of those who had increases felt that there was better quality or improved survival rates of their crops. However, only 32% (or 19 out of 59) of all respondents established an explicit direct connection between the increase in their yields over the period analyzed and the use of the innovation. Many other factors besides the innovation played a critical role on crop survival rates and farmers’ results. \n\nAmong the main factors that were seen as hindering production, rat infestations and extreme weather conditions were highlighted as problems that the innovation is not able to solve or provide a useful solution to, therefore not having a significant impact on yields. In fact, Mozambique is well known for suffering from extreme weather events and variability, such as droughts and floods that have direct consequences on agriculture. These results thus raise the question as to what extent the innovation has been able to impact crop survival and yields in unfavourable scenarios such as the one found in Mozambique.\n\nData also shows that farmers who received advice on farming practices or this type of information combined with the location of problems in their farms obtained better yields then those who only received information on the location of problems 85% of the farmers who received advice on farming practices had an increase in their yields, while 15% saw no change in yields.",
      "Key Recommendations": "When it comes to farmers’ perceived benefits from innovation, the type of information deemed as most beneficial to farmers was not the main scope of the innovation (identifying in advance where\nproblems were occurring), but rather advice on farming practices. 56% of respondents (N=34) said that the service would be more effective if it not only identified where problems were located in the\nfarms but also provided means to solve these problems, mostly fertilizers and pesticides. The second most common suggestion was that the innovation should provide farmers with more advice on\nfarming practices.",

      "Key Findings": "As an institution focused on developing human understanding through open ended inquiry, it is highly adept at forming critical and methodical scholars who can turn their beings towards solving\nintractable problems of science and society.  Yet it is not a dependable machine for creating all the kinds of value that are desired in the contemporary world. It is unpredictable what the impact of pedagogical engagements or research and scholarship might be, in terms of their outcomes and timeline. The critical enquiry engaged in by universities will inevitably question the very conceptions of development that underpin this instrumental role.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Universities to a certain extent need to be left to follow their own course, which at times will bring substantial material benefits to society, and at others not. Instrumental benefits will normally emerge organically from the intrinsically valuable processes of enquiry aimed at deepening human understanding, but if they are in conflict, if indeed it is possible for the university to make a contribution to the economy and society through bypassing or stifling open-ended enquiry, it is the latter and not the former that must be safeguarded.",

They may have no major impact in enhancing such networks, but they can make positive contributions to the knowledge networks targeted by R4D interventions. It also indicates that MSPs can contribute to stakeholders’ shared understanding and learning. However, its contribution to participation and engagement are highly dependent on periodic cycles. In addition, it shows that the factors that influence the process outcomes and their drivers vary.",
      "Key Recommendations": "This paper provides a first analysis of the early stages of the MSP networks in Burundi, Rwanda and DCR. Continuous mapping of MSP networks over time will enable a longitudinal analysis of network evolution and also link it to actual MSP performance with regard to achieving development impacts. From the results of this study, we can make some recommendations for the MSPs in\nthe three countries based on their current structural characteristics and deficiencies, combined with insights into the underlying processes that are likely to have influenced the networks’ formation. Such insights could be used proactively to think about innovation network ‘architecture’ or ‘building’ to achieve specific types of innovations, innovation processes or scaling pathways (Spielman et al., 2008; Prell et al., 2009; Spielman et al., 2011). In all three countries, this recommendation has to do with the\ninclusion of more farmer and business representatives within the MSP, to ensure that innovation and scaling is more end-user inclusive. For DRC and Burundi, more attention should be paid to developing the knowledge exchange network in order to\nconnect the different parts of the network (across hierarchies and spatial scales).",

      "Key Findings": "The findings from the participatory workshop and the literature review elucidate the importance of co-production and collaboration between researchers, policy-makers and other stakeholders to improve research utilisation in policy-making. This echoes similar findings in other research focused on uptake of SRHR research in policy-making. \n\nThe importance of identifying opportunities and strategic phases in the research and policy cycle where uptake of evidence could be maximised through dialogue with stakeholders is supported by evidence from the case studies discussed in the research in Ghana, Belgium and Kenya, as well as by other research done in the Netherlands among stakeholders working in international development and SRHR. \n\nThe workshop identified key strategies for translating research into policy, including joint agenda-setting between researchers and policy-makers, as well as building trust and partnerships with different stakeholders. These were linked to stages within Hanney et al.’s framework as opportunities for engaging with policy-makers to ensure uptake of research findings. Joint agenda-setting has been mentioned as an important approach for advocating the prioritisation of specific SRHR issues and an opportunity for policy framing, especially in low- and middle-income contexts.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Trust building is critical for translating research into policy or practice. However, trust building takes substantial but worthwhile time and resource investment. Building trust and fostering partnerships with policy-makers, service providers and other stakeholders should be a continuous process and not only at the point of research dissemination.\n\nInformal meetings provide an opportunity for researchers to network with stakeholders like policymakers.\nThere are many advantages gained from building trust and fostering partnerships between researchers and other stakeholders. These include, but are not limited to, increased uptake of research findings by different stakeholders.\n\nResearchers should engage with the media to ensure public dissemination of key research findings and emphasise key SRHR issues.\n\nResearchers should identify ‘knowledge gaps’ for policy-making and target their research to address these. Opportunities exist to develop an accountability framework between researchers and policymakers. This can help in ensuring that health policies developed are evidence based and effective in addressing the most relevant problems and the most vulnerable populations. ",

      "Key Findings": "When investigating norms and economic policy, we are concerned about what system of beliefs supports and defines norms. Once we understand these beliefs, we can tell whether the behaviors that we observe are norm-driven or not, measure the consistency between beliefs and behavior under different conditions, and make predictions about future behaviors. We find that the theoretical prediction for long-exposure beneficiaries is similar to the observed data. The results support policy interventions that have a social component, as they could provide mechanisms allowing for the solution of coordination failures within a community. More importantly, this study contributes to the current debate among policy makers on how to assess community attributes and their relevance for development\n\nWe overcome the complexity of this assessment by using three different economic games that capture social communities' attributes: coordination, cooperation and networks.\n",

      "Key Findings": " The evaluation found that inaccurate assumptions and planning led to flaws in the original design, which were influenced by the lack of co-design with GOL partners. The management structure and approach was risky and lacked consistent and reliable oversight. The redesign was appropriate in fixing the constraints by integrating components better, promoting cross-pollination, and shifting toward a multi-agency approach to combating corruption. Since the redesign, LPAC experienced uneven progress working with the legal and regulatory institutions but achieved the greatest results and value with the LNBA and LACC. Participation of women grew by piloting legal aid clinics, increasing Public Service Scholarships and focusing on women’s participation in judicial trainings.\n",

USAID should adapt the language in the scope to reflect a continuation of administrative and financial capacity building for LNBA and LACC, as appropriate, but remove this aspect of the scope from the Judicial Institute and Law School. USAID should commission an assessment of women’s involvement in rule of\nlaw in Liberia.",

However, there remain several opportunities to tackle these challenges, and USAID stands poised to strategically address key systematic constraints that would have a transformative impact on Haiti’s economy and food security. In convening a diverse set of actors, USAID has accessed a brain trust whose cumulative knowledge of the environment and cumulative creativity have been captured in this report. These stakeholders thoughtfully identified constraints that they feel most affect Haiti’s ability to generate wealth as a country and ensure food security for its people.",
      "Key Recommendations": "USAID could support a program focused on increased exports of high value products, a mechanization cost share model to increase agriculture productivity and the creation of MIP (Mini Industrial Park) model by convening stakeholders with knowledge of past attempts to develop MIPs to identify constraints and lessons learned.\nBroker linkages throughout the value chain by linking farmers to MIPs. Farmer groups could serve as virtual members, since they do not produce inside the park.\nHelp identify areas or buildings with existing assets that would require little infrastructure investment to serve as MIP through brokering partnerships. This could also be a business opportunity for an entrepreneur owner of a building or land which could be converted to a MPIs. S/he could receive rent from entrepreneurs inside the MIP.",

      "Key Findings": "Having established that the current funding levels for basmati R&D are woefully inadequate and that\nPakistan’s basmati export could be increased by additional funding for basmati R&D, the question arises\nas to the best remedy. Two important aspects need attention: first, the source of funding, and second,\nthe oversight and transmission mechanism of the funding.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Modern models of R&D funding rely on a combination of public grants, industry contributions, and fees\nand levies. However, a substantial increase from Pakistan’s public exchequer is unlikely. One option is\nto institute a cess (levy) fund based on contributions from farmers. An expanded version could involve\nall participants of value chain, so that all participants’ resources can be pooled for mutual benefit, given\nthat rice R&D is advantageous to all stakeholders in the value chain. However, the expectation that\nPakistan’s farmers will willingly agree to an R&D levy is unrealistic, as their ability to pay is uncertain and\nthey frequently complain about input costs and lack of subsidies.\nAlternately, the other end of the chain might be more conducive to such an initiative. Processing and\nexport stages involve the greatest value addition for rice. Such stages of the value chain are also better\ndocumented, better organized, and more cognizant of the need for better R&D to be able to compete in international markets. The burden of a cess at the export end is less onerous than at the farm end, and\nthe amount that can be collected will be greater. Given that the exporters gain the most in the rice value\nchain, it is only fair that R&D contributions should come from them. And, imposing a levy at the farm\nend could distort the growers’ behavior to the detriment of rice cultivation if they switch to other crops.",

It took some time, for example, to recruit the first group of students. At the commencement of the program, NDIGD was not affiliated with a specific college at the university and had to work overtime to share the opportunities with its many affiliated faculty, who then passed the information on to their students. Key relationships were\ndeveloped with the Kroc Institute (Peace Studies) and the Eck Center for Global Health. Both organizations were then eager to partner due to the many students who went abroad from their programs.\n\nOver the course of the implementation, one-on-one meetings were instituted to help students understand the impact, if any, on any fellowship support they were already receiving from the university. This was most concerning to PhD students who received living stipends. NDIGD was able to work with the student, their faculty advisors, as well as their departments to address any questions or concerns. In addition, conducting several meetings with fellows prior to their departure proved to be an effective way for fellows and NDIGD staff to get to know each other. We used these opportunities to let fellows know of the various resources available\non campus and externally to help them in making travel preparations as well as living abroad.",

      "Key Recommendations": "-The ET recommends SIIL ME budget for and organize workshops in Phase 1 to develop Impact Pathways for the above innovations toward targeted country scaling up in alliance with other development partners, both national and international.\n-With respect to scaling up, the ET recommends: a) future research efforts be required to consider scaling challenges from the beginning of Phase 2; and b) ME should consider launching a new research theme in Phase 2 to identify the optimal approaches to farmer-level knowledge acquisition and application, with particular emphasis on knowledge intensive innovations, such as IPM or CA-based SI and/or multi-component innovations, such as the CA-based, dry-season, irrigated horticulture production.\n-Given the good progress made in much of the SI on-farm research in many sites, the ET recommends in Phase 1 a participatory appraisal of farm women, men and youth’s evaluation of SI technologies in order to inform priorities for Phase 2.\n- In Phase1 ASMC can and should expand its efforts toward creating a digitized knowledge-archiving and sharing facility—functioning in-perpetuity—on specific technologies and their implementation for Appropriate Scale Mechanization (ASM) covering global innovations to reduce “re-invention of the wheel.”\n-Include more analysis of future needs and opportunities concerning appropriate implements for SI innovation adoption.\n-The ET recommends, in Phase 2, expansion in research on non-animal-traction-level mechanization in targeted farming systems that, where appropriate, will also include farmer-based supplemental irrigation (including possible use of solar pumps and of lay flat plastic pipe) to expand production cycles for SI.",

      "Key Findings": "About two-thirds of supported agribusinesses expressed some confidence in the growth potential of their firm, particularly in the East and South. While some enterprises were informal and small, they still expressed confidence in their growth potential.\nTwo-thirds of supported agribusinesses across the RADPs reported changing or adapting during the project period.\nKII findings supported contractors’ M&E data that RADP assistance resulted in over half of private enterprises and organizations applying improved organization-level technologies or management practices. Businesses reported that technical assistance helped increase staff capacity and market linkages, while in-kind support helped improve efficiency, product quality, and production capacity.\nTwo-thirds of businesses reported that RADP support had a positive effect on their business, including improved efficiency, staff capacity, and market linkages.\nNearly half of business respondents identified their business models as sustainable.\nOver three-quarters of businesses reported key challenges that they still face. Insecurity was the most commonly reported challenge (nearly half of businesses), a lack of equipment and machinery (a quarter of businesses), and limited profits, cash flow, or access to finance (a quarter of businesses.\nFindings suggest that the agribusiness support model is more likely to be sustainable for businesses with high growth potential.\nA majority of RADP supported businesses demonstrated some level of ability to change and adapt during the project period. Businesses that were able to adapt to changing conditions are more likely to be sustainable.\nIssues stemming from the external environment pose risks to businesses’ future growth and sustainability",
      "Key Recommendations": "Future programs and RADP-East should: \nStrengthen and monitor quality of beneficiary selection so that training is provided to beneficiaries for who it will have the most value; ensuring that beneficiaries are farmers who engage in the targeted value chains will increase their likelihood of adopting new technologies and licit crops. \nFurther tailor the content of training to address the key constraints faced by farmers in different regions and to ensure that techniques and technologies promoted are accessible and feasible for farmers to implement.. \nIn drought-prone areas, provide more training to farmers and provide demonstrations on water conservation technologies and the production of drought resistant crops. \nInclude more market related training modules to male and female farmers to build their skills on how to access markets for relevant crops and livestock products, build relationships with buyers, negotiate with buyers, and access market information. \nProvide training to farmers that includes practical demonstrations and training at demonstration plots to improve the effectiveness of training on farmer learning and skill building.\nRADP-East should encourage their agribusiness grantees to provide female-only trainings to improve the accessibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of training for women. \nFuture programs and RADP-East should work with women to obtain financial assistance with the backing of male relatives if necessary, to improve their ability to start and grow businesses. \nFuture programs should tailor agribusiness support interventions to small women-owned enterprises and develop criteria for grants that are possible for female entrepreneurs and women-owned businesses to meet.

      "Key Findings": "The Sustainable Development Agenda aims to leave no one\nbehind. From a data collection perspective, it entails enhancing\ncurrent systems to gather adequate information about\ndifferent population groups, especially the small and vulnerable\nsegments of society. Monitoring the SDGs requires better, more\ngranular data to be available faster. To meet this challenge,\nnational statistical systems should capitalize on new data sources,\nparticularly big data.\nThe readiness of national statistical systems to harness\nbig data and other innovative data sources depends on several\nfactors, including hardware and software requirements for storing,\nexamining, and visualizing big data. Official statisticians need to\nstrengthen their skills in analyzing unstructured, unfiltered, and\ncomplex collages of data points collected for distinct purposes and\nwhich may not have clear target populations.\nUsing big data is not just about the actual data, but also about\nthe data ecosystem, i.e., the need for partnerships, frameworks,\nand communication strategies. Harnessing big data requires\nresearch to determine what does and does not work, capacity\ndevelopment in national statistical systems, and stronger partnerships and frameworks to sustain more timely, granular, and meaningful statistics.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Monitoring the 17 SDGs and the concomitant 169 targets have created new and huge demands on national statistical systems (NSSs). NSSs will have to report on more than 230 indicators in the official SDG indicators framework, with many of these indicators. \n\nIn summary, research and case studies on big data and its applications for SDG monitoring are needed to provide lessons on integrating conventional and innovative data sources. Further, it is essential that these lessons be turned into practical guidelines for NSS on the use of big data before they fully integrate data sources.",

      "Key Findings": "The overall objective of MRSCC is to promote a supporting institutional research environment at SREU which develops individual and institutional research capacities leading SREU to become a self-sustaining educational research institution in Afghanistan. Other objectives of the MRSCC are:\nTo generate creative research solutions in the low-resource settings\nTo promote culture of coordination and collaboration in research development\nTo expand research linkages with other interested partners beyond the boundaries of SREU\n\nMRSCC Guiding Principles\nThe implementation of MRSCC is based on the following guiding principles:\nThe SREU’s Low-resource Context - The MRSCC is developed with notion that research is an expensive undertaking and that SREU can’t expect to receive substantial funding either from government or donor agencies. SREU commits itself to focus on utilizing its available resources to develop research capacities. The SREU over the past 15 years have received substantial support from donor agencies that has helped SRUE to establish various resource centers, computer labs, inter-departmental libraries, science labs, teaching and learning materials, virtual technology equipment, career center, language lab and others. In addition, the 280-faculty staff provide strong human capital which SREU understands can be the backbone for the development of research capacities. The SREU leadership would like to use available resources within the university, and at the same it will seek external support by establishing sponsorships, partnerships, service delivery linkages with local industries, donor agencies, government ministries, and individual entrepreneurs.",
      "Key Recommendations": "The successful implementation of MRSCC will require strong commitment from SREU leadership, the head of research committee, research committee members, MRSCC function-holders and entire faculty. To keep the momentum continuing, it is recommended that the SREU leadership and MRSCC function holders consider students’ involvement once MRSCC solidifies institutionalized base at SREU and the Graduate Education Senior Manager of USWDP maintains follow up meetings with SREU leadership and head of Research Committee to make sure MRSCC function-holders are appointed soon. It is important that qualified and committed faculty are selected for these critical positions and after the first year of successful completion of MRSCC functions, the relevant function-holders are rewarded for their committed contributions and efforts. SREU leadership needs to come up with attractive reward mechanisms for the successful\nfunction-holder faculty.",

      "Document Title": "Linked Boundary Functions: Examining the Role of ‘Research for Development’ Organizations in Integrating Levels of Resource Governance",
      "Key Findings": "Our findings showed that the facilitative activities and partnership approach of ACIAR\nFisheries Program staff marked the agency as a boundary-spanning actor in the Solomon Islands, placing the agency as an influencer, through program staff activities, rather than as a passive funds provider. As such, ACIAR’s approach is consistent with the turn toward ‘research for’ or ‘research in’ development by research brokers. We also established that ACIAR had invested resources and energy into the development of partnerships with other R4D agencies as a complement to its partnership approach with the Solomon Islands Government.\n\t\nViewed through the lens of linked boundary functions, the boundary work of each agency, ACIAR, and WorldFish, were necessary conditions, but neither alone were sufficient conditions, for the integration of the top-down and bottom-up approaches. Further, the strong partnership approach between ACIAR and WorldFish ensured this integration was meaningful and accessible to both local communities and Government agencies. The lens of boundary theory suggested that ACIAR’s distinct ongoing facilitative activities as part of the boundary chain were likely to have been important.\n\nACIAR’s partnership with the Solomon Islands Government was a necessarily supportive condition for top-down attentiveness to local solutions but was not, in itself, sufficient for generating the substantive credible and salient bottom-up content.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Findings, therefore, suggest that linked boundary function theory is likely to be a useful avenue for empirical research. Such research would further our understanding of how integrated resource governance can be progressed given the complexity of the research for the development environment.",

Linkages among stakeholders has been built theough training workshops, meetings, field days and seminars. A total of 88 men (48) and women (40) were enrolled for M.S. or Ph.D. training. Around 14,492 people received short-term training. Yields of crops such as rice, maize and chickpea has been increased.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Evaluation team recommends yearly review of progress through semi-annual and annual reports. USAID/BFS AOR should make an effort necessary to ensure timely funding. IPM IL should continue to serve as a catalyst to encourage and facilitate bio-pesticide business deveopment wih the stakeholders, encourage and provide training to rear the biocontrol agents using locally available materials to ensure the sustainability, pay attention to the marketing problem for improved rice varieties and conducts s socio-economic analysis of the situation.

      "Document Title": "LASER-PULSE: Assessment of the Research Context and Research Capacity in Higher Education Institutions in Africa",
      "Key Findings": "Makerere University, a LASER consortium member, led a capacity assessment to identify barriers to research and its translation in Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) in selected universities in sub-Saharan Africa, with the goal of identifying priority gaps for capacity building. \nA total of 27 universities (75% of targeted institutions) from 12 African countries participated. \nThe research capacity area in which universities scored highly was ‘national research engagement’ (mean score=3.7/5). Scored moderately were in research areas: (a) research strategies and policies (mean score=3.3/5), (b) institutional support services and infrastructure (mean score=3.1/5), (c) supporting funding applications (3.4/5), (d) human resource management for research, (e) human resource development for research (3.3/5), promotion of research visibility (3.3/5), and (f) linkages, partnerships, and collaboration (3.1/5).\n\nRegarding ‘research policies and guidelines’, HEIs scored highly on availability of a research policy and guidelines (85.2% scoring ‘good-very good’; mean score 4.5) and on research-outputs-based promotion (mean score=4.2). They scored weakly on availability of policies for commercialization of research (48.1% scoring ‘weak-to-very weak’; mean score of 2.5), on incentivizing research (37% of universities scored ‘weak-to very weak’; mean score=2.9), and on availability of clear policies to protect intellectual property (mean score=2.9).\n\nUnder ‘institutional support services and infrastructure’, the sub-dimensions of strength were the presence of research coordination offices at the top management level (for which 81.4% of universities scored ‘good to very good’; mean score=4.1), and presence of grants management unit (51% of universities scored ‘good-to-very good’; mean score=3.0). Areas of weakness included adequacy of research labs (mean score=2.4), data management policies and infrastructure (mean score=2.7), and adequacy of capacity for ethical and scientific review of research (mean score=2.8).\n\nUnder ‘human resource management and development for research’, low scoring: administrative research support staff and availability of a predictable and sustainable remuneration structure for non-academic technical research staff. On ‘human resource development for research’, universities scored highest on availability of field attachments and field training for students (mean score=4.5), and lowest on availability of post-doctoral training programs. The development areas with the largest capacity gaps both in terms of the distribution of expertise and numbers of available experts were: 1) working in crises and conflict, (2) energy, 3) gender, (4) democracy and governance, and 5) water and sanitation.",
      "Key Recommendations": "HEIs in Africa and the Sector Ministries under which they are aligned should aim to increase the capacity for research leadership. At the sector level, this requires increased funding for research activities in universities. At the HEI level, increased research capacity should be attained through institutionalization of training courses on research leadership and research project management and making them accessible to all researchers. \n\nTo make universities more relevant to the national development priorities, universities should strengthen their linkages to government sectors when creating their research agendas. Government sectors should view universities as partners in development that can provide evidence-based solutions to priority development challenges. Research agendas need to be widely consultative, to include relevant sectors, private sector actors and implementing agencies, so that they reflect the priority information needs of entities at the forefront of development programs’ implementations. \n\nThe continuity and sustainability of research should become a priority for African HEIs. Governments in the region should increase their investments in research by providing dedicated funding to research and innovation projects in universities, especially those that align with national development goals. Universities also need to engage governments to leverage more appropriations for research in the national budgets and to increase their in-house capacity to write grants to other funders. Universities should increase their lobbying and advocacy for increased funding for research, so that policy makers appreciate the role that research can play in transforming their countries.",

      "Key Findings": "1. Establishing platforms for multi-stakeholder engagement builds self-reliant institutions and sustained action but requires dedicated time and resources up-front.\n\n2. The grants program is an effective mechanism for supporting the broad needs of higher education institutions, however management resources must be allocated to ensure adequate capacity building and oversight.\n\n3. Applied research and curriculum alignment must begin with a comprehensive sector analysis of the needs of the private sector as its starting point.\n\n4. Faculty training strategies should take into account extenuating factors that can inhibit participation and successful completion, especially for long-term trainings.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Building Self Reliant Institutions\nContinue to promote institutional mechanisms to facilitate sustained collaboration between universities and industry. Given the time and effort needed to create relationships that form the foundation of effective cluster platforms, it is recommended that USAID continue focusing on the four clusters already in operation and identify 1-2 more that are ripe for collaboration. Likewise, it is important to continue to involve government agencies, given that they are the principal policy makers providing the enabling environment for industry-higher education partnerships to thrive.\nStrengthen the newly formed CIESCE and the sector associations with which it has an alliance.\n\nAdvancing Economic Growth and Competitiveness \nContinue to invest in global certification trainings to improve the skills and competencies of university professors and future graduates. Internationally recognized certifications will improve the talent pool and thereby productivity in high-growth sectors. Taking advantage of the cluster model, new training centers and professional associations with international affiliations could be developed in each cluster. For example, Microsoft academies and similar centers capable to certify competencies in El Salvador.\nDevelop new innovation capacities in universities in line with private sector priorities and government policies. There is an opportunity to build on the commercialization potential of applied research efforts by helping move universities toward processes of innovation that will strengthen their institutions and promote technology transfer to industry. The knowledge technology and transfer offices set up by USAID in other countries such as the Philippines can be looked to as a model for adaptation.",

      "Key Findings": "Recent interest in community-engaged research and teaching among both universities and funding agencies offers an opportunity for responsibly-conducted applied research that integrates the knowledge of practitioners, asks practice-informed questions, prepares students, and maintains successful partnerships.  Youth development researchers are well-poised to forge collaborations with communities, as understanding and supporting children’s development is a common interest all communities share. Yet, both researcher and practitioner partners should be prepared to encounter challenges. \n\nSuccessful partnerships can advance our understanding of youth development and help us improve the lives of youth, who stand to benefit from a nationwide Cooperative Extension network that can help spread good developmental practices to children and families\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "Formal infrastructures like the PRYDE initiative can help guide successful partnerships and assist partners in navigating the barriers at the institution and community levels that can make collaboration challenging.   Similar programs such as PROSPER—which links Cooperative Extension networks across both Iowa State University and Pennsylvania State University—report positive effects on community members' views of Cooperative Extension programming. However, not all researchers and practitioners have access to intermediary organizations like PRYDE or PROSPER or even to the Cooperative Extension network.\nIn the absence of these formal supports, we expect that there is an even greater imperative to discuss and clarify the distinct language, values, and motivations that researchers and practitioners bring to a collaboration. Establishing the motivations and expectations of both partners is a useful trust-building exercise, not just at the outset of a project but through ongoing reflection on the partnership process itself. In our experience, the keys to success are to seek partnerships that incorporate practitioner insights early and extend over time. In particular, our advice emphasizes ways that researchers can meet practitioners in the applied settings and conferences in which they work, and together design studies that fit within the paradigms that exist in their youth programs. We also underscore the benefits of creating opportunities for youth to be meaningfully involved in these research collaborations. Readied with our advice for initiating successful collaboration, we encourage readers to identify their state Cooperative Extension network—or seek out youth-serving organizations in their community—and explore new partnerships.\n\n\n\n\n",

      "Key Findings": "The Panel noted that it is important to consider the operating environment from which publications arise when comparing publication and citation data. The publications in this case study arise from projects in developing countries with facilities and field conditions incomparable to those of developmental research in developed countries. The Panel noted that ACIAR is both a development agency and a research organization and that measuring scientific impact of the Program based on its publication outputs alone was insufficient.\n\nOur findings showed that data on publication outputs and citation rates were skewed because of a few outstanding projects or publications. Waltman (2016) noted that this effect, driven by a few relatively highly cited publications, is commonplace. Sub-field differences also influence citation rates, for example, taxonomic papers, of which 11 from this study were published in the journal Zootaxa, generally have low citations because once a species is described, it is rarely necessary subsequently to cite the original journal article. This is also reflected in the relatively low impact factor of that journal. \n\nAnother noteworthy point is the apparent value of collaborative research. The literature suggests that international collaboration and inter-disciplinarity are positively related to increased publication and citation. This generality seems to hold true in the current study, which showed bi-lateral and multi-lateral projects on average tended to produce a larger number of journal articles and attracted more citations per funded dollar compared to projects conducted in a single partner country .\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "Generally speaking, projects with greater funding or longer time frames did not produce greater ‘bang for the buck’—inferring that small and modestly-funded projects were (roughly) as productive in scientific impacts per funded dollar. We can, therefore, conclude that R4D institutions require clear and enforceable policies and procedures about publication outputs if their funding programs are to be assessed and benchmarked upon bibliometric measures.\n\nOur analysis also suggests that the metrics used to evaluate the scientific impacts of R4D organizations need to be broader and more nuanced than those of the researchers and their respective commissioned academic institutions. Such measures should include aspects of capability development and recognition of the benefits of research to the R4D agency’s home country. R4D organizations are also advised to engage with their key stakeholders to agree on the measures of importance, and how relevant data are to be collected and analyzed. \n",

The SRP accomplishes this through its university-based centers which provide practical and scientific solutions to develop, test, and implement unique approaches to address complex environmental health problems.\n\nA unique aspect of the SRP is that, beyond the biomedical, environmental sciences, and engineering research projects, SRP-funded centers are required to include community engagement to build partnerships with affected communities and research translation to communicate and facilitate the use of research findings. The SRP views research translation as communicating and facilitating the use of research findings emanating from the center in a manner most appropriate for their application and for the advancement of a center’s research objectives. \n\nThe SRP ensures that the research it supports is reciprocated in an easy to understand manner to the individuals and communities that can utilize and benefit from the research. By encouraging SRP grantees to focus on developing and sharing risk prevention messages with their community partners, it allows for the basic research findings to be translated into actions that improve public health.",

      "Key Findings": "Grounded in normative values, the Canadian Center for Global Health Research (CCGHR) Principles for Global Health Research can serve as a broadly relevant framework to guide how to integrate equity considerations into everyday research, knowledge translation, and practice activities. Comprised of six principles (authentic partnering, inclusion, shared benefits,commitment to the future, responsiveness to causes of inequities, and humility), they are an aspirational and reflective frame that can elevate equity as a central procedural goal and outcome. These principles can inform dialogue about how to sustain equity interests within a political economy that continues to advance threats to the long-held ideal of a more equitable world. They invite reflective consideration in both process and outcomes of health equity work, and offer a supportive guidance structure for promoting ethical and equitable choices.",

The study examined the innovation capacity building of both institutions through measuring the transformational leadership styles in engineering colleges and its impact on the faculty’s innovative production of technical articles, patents, and sustainable development related courses. \n\nThis study disclosed that, in the high-power distance contexts, the idealized image of the leader contributed positively toward higher satisfaction of the followers with their leaders and current governance systems, while acknowledgment and rewards were the sources of satisfaction in low-power distance societies. Followers in a low uncertainty avoidance, individualistic, and short-term-oriented context achieved higher technical production.\n",

      "Key Findings": "Analysis of interviews and survey responses showed that the Fisheries Program made a significant contribution to the research capacity of local staff and research organizations involved and contributed to policy changes in the case study countries. The analysis identified evidence of Research Capacity Development (RCD) outcomes across all three levels: individual, organizations, and systems.\n\nThe assessment showed that the investment in RCD generated organizational level outcomes in partner countries such as improved human resource capability and research expertise; as well as the availability and accessibility of capital, infrastructure, technology, and services. These changes, in turn, have improved the productivity and sustainability of fisheries and aquatic farming systems and resources \n\nThe case studies demonstrate the link between RCD and the SDGs. However, it is worth noting that these results were obtained under specific contextual and programmatic circumstances, which\nmay change with a change in the context or the strategic positioning of actors \n\nDocument analysis, survey, and interview results showed that individuals’ participation in project training and related activities resulted in improved skills in experimental design and data analysis, research and project management skills, and increased publication output among local researchers. The results also showed that there were improved research and project management skills among government officials and research managers, and increased fisheries management skills among extension workers and farmers in local communities.\n\nOverall, analyses of survey and interviews showed that the outcomes of the RCD investment of the Fisheries Program have contributed to system-level changes to national R&D systems and fisheries policy. \n",
      "Key Recommendations": "Merely increasing research knowledge and skills is not enough to generate RCD outcomes. R4D requires knowledge and skills to be applied in order to produce tangible outcomes. Outcomes are also dependent on other factors such as the availability of resources. These include appropriate technologies and facilities at the organizational level and an enabling environment both at the institutional and national levels.\n\nThe authors suggest future research to focus on the creation of assessment and evaluation tools to analyze the strength and weakness of links between RCD and SDGs and quantify the contributions of a research project to SDGs.\n",

      "Key Findings": "The challenges facing the world today are complex, and no single organization or sector can hope to effectively confront these issues alone. Not only is partnership increasingly seen as a multi-stakeholder phenomenon rather than a bilateral one, but there also is a discernible move towards a network framing (e.g., as “innovation systems” or “boundary spanning”). This change is driven by the progressive inclusion of agricultural research goals as part of the wider development agenda, where complexity and systemic change are central. In turn, this requires more appropriate strategies for knowledge creation, innovation, and partnership. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "No particular disciplinary credential (whether breeding, economics, agronomy, etc.) alone signals the necessary skills and capabilities to understand and assess agri-food systems as complex, coupled systems involving ecological and economic phenomena and indeed requiring understanding of interactions across these coupled systems. Scientific leadership for agri-food systems programs depends primarily on capacity for systems thinking, embodying competencies in “the analysis of complex systems, integrating societal, environmental and economic perspectives … understanding of complexity, holistic approaches, and how the parts relate to the whole,” which can be learned through formal study beyond conventional academic disciplines and also can be developed through training and experience.",

      "Key Findings": "Knowledge translation (KT) is a dynamic and iterative process that includes synthesis, dissemination, exchange and ethically sound application of knowledge to yield beneficial outcomes for society. Effective KT requires researchers to play an active role in promoting evidence uptake. This paper presents a systematized review of evidence on low- and middle-income country (LMIC) researchers’ KT capacity, practice and interventions for enhancing their KT practice (support) with the aim of identifying gaps and informing future research and interventions.\n\nThe findings suggest that LMIC researchers rarely conduct KT and face a range of barriers at individual and institutional levels that limit their KT practice, including inadequate KT knowledge and skills, particularly for communicating research and interacting with research end-users, insufficient funding, and inadequate institutional guidelines, structures and incentives promoting KT practice.

The international examples show that both approaches are implemented, in practice, in variety of ways and include a series of complementary supports.\nThey act as one-stop shops for information and advice on existing regulation, provide temporary exemptions, offer funding for (collaborative) research and innovation projects, provide access to testing facilities, and promote networking and knowledge sharing.\n\n3.

Types of AI vary, but most use some form of machine learning or signal processing. Several types of machine learning methods are frequently used together, as is machine learning with other approaches, most often signal processing. AI-driven health interventions fit into four categories relevant to global health researchers: (1) diagnosis, (2) patient morbidity or mortality risk assessment, (3) disease outbreak prediction and surveillance, and (4) health policy and planning.",

      "Key Recommendations": "GOVERNANCE/LEADERSHIP\n1. Select and appoint project directors that have the required skills and experience to fully execute the project agreement. Seek comprehensive feedback and input on terms of reference from other projects and USAID staff.\n2. Create a unified cooperative agreement for all partners that can be reviewed jointly with USAID at or before the project kickoff.\n3. Security concerns should be taken into consideration while designing the project, selecting implementation partners, and developing work plans.\n4. The development of the strategic plan and road map, as well as leadership planning and training, should be conducted within the first few months of the project’s start.\n5. New centers should be integrated with other schools at their host university to leverage existing resources and strengths and ensure buy-in and sustainability.\nCURRICULUM\n1. Conduct a comprehensive survey and assessment of workforce needs before or at the start of the project.\n2. At the agreement stage, ensure that any gender equality plan is realistic and reflects a reasonable stretch goal to improve existing participation over time with milestones, regular review, and course corrections.\n3. To launch degree programs quickly, leverage existing curriculum as a basis for new programs.\n4. Create mandatory pedagogy training in the first year of the project with yearly reviews and additional training opportunities throughout the project.\n5. Create labs that serve a dual purpose: teaching and research. Partners should create lab utilization plans before procuring equipment so that labs can efficiently support both curriculum and research.\nRESEARCH\n1. Set expectations for research publications and presentations and quantify with metrics; review metrics regularly.\nProvide professional development opportunities for faculty on writing grant proposals and journal articles.\n2. Facilitate and support research presentations at academic and industry conferences.\n3. Host local research expos to showcase research done by faculty and students.\n4. Host workshops in-country. Work with partner institutions to ensure a near 100 percent participation rate by faculty and students.\n5. Create an efficient procurement process that empowers faculty.\n6. Create research evaluation forums that include relevant technical experts and create a communication mechanism that ensures continuity, and that brings new reviewers up to speed as needed.\nEXCHANGE\n1. The ASU exchange program was a transformational experience based on the feedback received from participating faculty, and students. A U.S. exchange program should be considered as a part of every donor-funded project in the area of higher education.\n2. Create an inclusion plan for women and economically disadvantaged students that factors current local participation rates and identifies incremental improvements that address cultural and economic barriers and enhance academic preparation in secondary schools.\nSUSTAINABILITY\n1. At the project start, create an action plan for strategic development, fundraising, and industry interaction that includes milestones and deliverables. Update the plan at least annually.\n2. Make sustainability a cross-cutting component or, more specifically, a mindset rather than a separate goal. In the USPCAS-E project, each component had sustainability goals. Creating a sustainability mindset ensures that all component-specific efforts align with the overall strategic direction of the centers.\n3. Identify key stakeholders and engage them regularly throughout the project. Create a stakeholders forum that meets biannually or quarterly.\n4. Create something like the National Energy Research Agenda at the beginning of the project as part of the strategic planning process.",

      "Document Title": "LASER PULSE Research for Development (R4D) Workshop Report",
      "Key Findings": "Advance Participant Perception about Research for Development\n-Researchers and practitioners from different organizations fall on different spectrums as related to their understanding of, and experience with, research for development, research translation, research capacity, research experience or capability and their motivation to partner for research. For example, Colombian university researchers rank high in capacity and experience with development research. Some university faculty members have opportunities to work with local communities directly in their research. On the other hand, many practitioners viewed academic research as limited in application to evaluations or assessments. This was noted in pre-workshop activities as well as during workshop sessions, when practitioners asked, \"Why should we partner with researchers? What is the value proposition for us in partnering with them?\"\n-Further segmentation of practitioners as implementers (NGOs), government actors and private sector actors; and researchers in private sector organizations, might be necessary to help with role clarification as relates to research for development. For example, we observed that participants from private sector foundations were challenged to understand their role in the workshop and what value they could add or obtain from such partnerships.\n-The ability for LASER to have the \"right\" (sector expertise) participants at these events was crucial to generate sector specific engagement. The Colombia workshop had a far more targeted group of participants, with respect to the sector priorities. Specific perhaps to Colombia’s greater focus on human rights (as opposed to Uganda’s focus on development) was a suggestion that we might have included demographic and social representatives of our sector focus areas - such as young people, to participate in the Youth sector. This is an ongoing reflection on whether expertise and experience should be balanced by representation and diversity, as we invite participants to these R4D events.\n\nEnhance Communication of the Purpose of R4D events\n-Pre-event engagement with researchers and practitioners was critical to get support and attendance. For example, it was noted from the Colombia pre-workshop activity with practitioners that this activity helped practitioners feel buy-in to the implementation of the workshop agenda.\n-Two R4D objectives must be more effectively communicated of this event: (1) Help researchers and practitioners to network and improve their use of research. (2) Identify/fund opportunities for research, so as to manage researcher expectations when they don’t see their specific research questions on the RFA.\n-Expectations must be clearly articulated during the pre-workshop activities, especially with the USAID Mission offices as we ask them to provide feedback, attend, give connections with their IP’s, etc. The Colombia Mission representatives expressed that their role and responsibilities could have been more clearly articulated in advance.\nContinuous Improvement of CSFA and other LASER Approaches\n-The CSFA survey responses from the scoping/advisory group of experts seemed more astute with respect to the three priority areas. Survey and Synthesis Template inputs from participants during the workshop were far more varied, as anticipated, reflecting the unique individual perspectives of each participant and their respective roles in the system. However, collectively, a significant fraction of participants in each of the challenge areas validated the gaps identified by the scoping groups. After synthesizing the direct outputs of the data instruments, critical gaps identified by participants for missing success factors were captured to help inform the RFA.\n-One recommendation for R4D events was to use local/regional (in this case, Colombian) examples for sessions whenever possible. This would make discussions more relevant to the participants.\n-Advance training of facilitators would better ensure that they are ‘on the same page’ about session content and concepts.\n\nThe strength of the Colombia R4D Workshop was in the depth of engagement from partners, so that the conference seemed to be co-led by local participants. This level of engagement was possible because of Purdue and University of Notre Dame’s long-term partnerships, and the LASER team’s relationships with the government, academic institutions and development organizations in Colombia. Some adjustments from the Uganda R4D - especially around the use of the CSFA-derived sessions enhanced the overall effectiveness of the workshop in generating data to shape the RFA. The successful engagement of participants at the Colombia R4D workshop has contributed to a model for R4D events, which we will use to design all future conferences. A caveat here is that context and opportunity are important elements in the implementation of any event.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. We will take advantage of LASER consortium connections as well as mission enthusiasm for the LASER approach in the selection of the R4D event host country or region. This ensures we are able to delve deeper into context, and to engage our boundary partners earlier and more effectively.\n2. Continue to elaborate pre-event engagement activities. We will continue to engage practitioners and researchers as groups prior to the event, as early on as possible. This ensures that these participants feel a sense of ownership in the event, and are likely (as they did in Colombia), take on session facilitation roles. It also means they are more prepared for the event, having thought through the challenges to engaging with researchers (or practitioners, depending on the participant); their previous experiences engaging with the other, and the terms and outcomes of that engagement to share with other event participants. And, of course, it means that they are able to propose research gaps in the USAID sectors presented as priorities for the event. This also provides us with an opportunity to define ‘research,’ so that researchers and practitioners alike aren’t only thinking in terms of a research study that results in a peer-reviewed and published paper, but see it as LASER would like them to, which is as ‘the expertise of a researcher applied in collaboration with practitioners, to a development challenge identified from the field, resulting in an innovative product, new practices, or policy recommendations, and for which there is a ready application once the researcher-implementer joint work is concluded.\n3. Continue to improve the process to refine the sector priorities for the R4D workshop. The ability of LASER to have identified system gaps per sector at a very granular level by the time of the event is crucial to our expecting to have RFA focus areas emerge from it. And to get to this, we need to have the sector focus clearly identified and narrowed, and the feedback on gaps from the Scoping Group members (sometimes called Advisory or Leadership Group in the past) through the pre-workshop CSFA survey.\na. We will seek to send out the CSFA sector survey to Scoping Group members as early in the process as possible. However, the caveat for effectively performing this activity is the advance time required to refine the CSFA surveys with USAID Mission’s input on specific priorities in particular sectors. For example, USAID Vietnam Mission’s direction towards water and air pollution specifically under the broad sector ‘watershed’ or ‘water resource management’.\nb. The other prerequisite for the success of this activity is the ability to identify in advance the Scoping Group members, given the special selection criteria of this group (as discussed on Page 5 of this report). The pre-workshop engagement activities will be crucial for engaging and identifying the “right” experts for the Scoping Group.\n4. Continue to identify processes and activities that can be standardized across different R4D events, but customize and adapt to cultural and contextual needs of the region. Despite success we have using certain approaches in a given country, we recognize the need to adapt our approaches to the socio-political and cultural context of the next R4D event host country. What worked well in the context of Colombia might not work well in the context of Vietnam. Some elements of the R4D events will remain: The How-To of Translation, and the use of CSFA to refine the USAID-identified sector priorities, for example. But we will adapt how we present these in a culturally responsive manner.",

      "Key Recommendations": "Lower-resource countries will need to invest in improvements in data quality, improve equity in access to care, establish safeguards to minimize the harmful effects of bias and address supportive linkages within the health system. Without these developments, the benefits of the new technologies may fail to materialize, further exacerbating health disparities within and between high- and low-income countries.",

      "Document Title": "Higher Education Scholarship Assessment: Final report",
      "Key Findings": "Based on addressing the following four areas, the findings of the report are:\n\n1. The Main Scholarship Providers: \nNational government institutions provide most graduate scholarships in Indonesia. The Indonesia Endowment for Education (Lembaga Penjamin Dana Pendidikan, or LPDP) has by far the largest budget and supports more scholarships than do other providers. Provincial governments also have substantial funding to support overseas studies but are smaller than national providers; only one of them included the United States as a study destination. Private providers generally lack overseas study options.\n\n2. Driving Factors: \nMultiple factors drive most scholarship providers, with the most common being human resource development. Government mandates are also an important driver among government institutions. Other salient driving factors, including support of provincial high achievers and disaster response, are present but more often a concern of provincial governments and private providers’ agendas than a national concern.\n\n3. Needs for Assistance:\nScholarship providers identified a variety of technical assistance needs that would benefit their programs. The most mentioned was building collaboration with international partners, focused on developing relationships with U.S. universities, and developing a better understanding of the U.S. university system to enable better application and placement decisions. Numerous funds also mentioned the need for co-funding with international governments and universities, indicating the scholarship providers’ concern for stretching their budgets to increase the number of overseas scholarships they can fund. Each scholarship provider has specific needs in scholarship management, which could not be generalized across funds.\n\n4. Monitoring and Evaluation:\nExisting M&E systems are underdeveloped and not suitable to measure the variety of anticipated scholarship impacts. Conversely, anticipated scholarship impacts are poorly defined and difficult to measure. Most provincial and private scholarship providers have a poor conceptualization of M&E and how to build and effectively use such systems.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Main Providers:\nUSAID could focus on providing technical assistance to the national scholarship providers as they have the funding and resources to work on improving their scholarship management. Provincial governments identified as main providers in this assessment also have funding to enable overseas studies. Private providers may not be the best option for support as they focus on domestic partial undergraduate scholarships.\n\n2. Driving Factors: \nUSAID could consider two factors in working with the targeted providers:\ni. Factors driving the provision of scholarships: It is logical to focus on assisting scholarship providers that are driven by the more permanent agenda of developing human resources. However, other factors, such as government mandates, also influence this driver. In this case, as exemplified by provincial providers, the longevity of the scholarship programs might be uncertain; it may depend on the agenda of the ruling government and thus can change with election cycles. Support for politically driven scholarship funds may be warranted, but USAID would have to readjust technical assistance as agendas and programs change.\nii. Organizational nature of the targeted scholarship providers: Some provincial providers were established specifically for administering scholarships and might be temporary agencies. Risk mitigation is always necessary for designing technical assistance programs, but special attention is warranted when working with ad hoc provincial scholarship agencies.\n\n3. Nees for Assistance: \nUSAID could consider providing the following technical assistance:\ni. Help facilitates special agreements between scholarship providers and U.S. universities. \nii. Create a hub for learning and disseminating best practices in scholarship management between both the Indonesian scholarship providers and international organizations and universities.\niii. Create a marketplace forum where scholarship providers and other co-funding collaborators meet physically or virtually.\niv. Increase interest in studying in the U.S. by addressing problems in Indonesian scholarship candidates’ reluctance to sit for graduate admissions tests such as the GMAT and GRE. USAID can work with other U.S.-sponsored agencies such as EducationUSA and the American Indonesian Exchange Foundation (AMINEF) to educate the public about the American graduate education system and the strategies to succeed in standardized academic and admissions tests.\nv. Share best practices in scholarship management based on lessons learned from the Prestasi Scholarship Program.\n\n4. Monitoring and Evaluation:\nAssistance in this area could begin with an assessment of M&E knowledge among the targeted providers. For scholarship providers with clear M&E planning and objectives, USAID can help formulate realistic impact objectives, design systems to measure the objectives, and train the staff in M&E. Providers without an M&E system, or those that have a poor understanding of M&E needs related to measuring scholarship impact, will require help building basic capacity, including systems.",

Co-production promises to address the complex nature of contemporary sustainability challenges better than more traditional scientific approaches. But definitions of knowledge co-production are diverse and often contradictory. The authors propose a set of four general principles that underlie high-quality knowledge co-production for sustainability research.",

      "Document Title": "Towards an entrepreneurial university: case of Tunisia",
      "Key Findings": "Our study took into account entrepreneurial orientation towards the creation and development of entrepreneurial university. Indeed, five dimensions (innovation, autonomy, risk taking, proactiveness and competitiveness) characterize the entrepreneurial process, i.e. the entrepreneurial orientation of a university.\nIn this respect, innovation is a very important factor in creating and developing an entrepreneurial university. This confirms the opinions of several authors, such as Clark (1998). \nAn innovative university is a the one that has new programmes, creates new courses, brings new ideas, implements new pedagogies, promotes the development of an internal motivation system, facilitates the creation of spin-offs, integrates new working methods, uses new structures and proposes new management methods.\nAccording to the results of several empirical studies, for a university to become entrepreneurial, it must be autonomous. An autonomous university is the one which works in complex and changing environments that it can change by creating hybrid forms, can stand alone and always makes difficult choices that determine its future, then it can think and act alone, and can undertake and create new activities without a minimum autonomy. This translates into the freedom of choice and academic autonomy.\nOther results of our work indicate that a risk-taking university is the one that has a favorable attitude towards a certain risk, decides to make unknown things, makes decisions in risky situations, and has an aggressive competitive position for the survival of new businesses. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "This research has some limitations. For instance, we believe that using a larger sample of 532 officials, rather than a small one, would have helped to make our results most representative. As for the selection of the sample, we merely distribute our questionnaire to university officials, while another survey of entrepreneurship teachers and students might have enriched the research findings. In addition, future research might be interested in testing this study in other types of universities and regions with a larger sample to find new dimensions or conclusions. Future researchers can complete our remarks by focusing on these important aspects for both research in the field of entrepreneurship and for the creation and development of entrepreneurial universities to enhance the employability of graduates.",

Running research alongside training efforts to build\ncapacity, but also to identify the real barriers to implementation of best practice;",
      "Key Recommendations": "To ensure successful implementation of knowledge and new methods, political support is extremely important. A strong focus should be an improvement of collaboration and network development. Rehabilitation, early and late pallative care, cost effectiveness and long-term follow-up are priorities. Limitations are budget constraints which limit the execution of NCCPs.\n\n",

      "Key Recommendations": "To stimulate the uptake of successful innovation experiments, it is recommended that practitioners pay more attention to the anchoring of these niche experiments.\nIt is also recommended that R4D projects valorize their work and pay more explicit attention to anchoring. With a flexible, multi-pronged anchoring approach and continuous scanning of the progress made in context, more R4D projects and their associated innovation methodologies can ‘go to scale\n",

      "Key Findings": "The author finds that the effect of Democracy, Human Rights, and Governance (DRG) expenditures decreased dramatically in the 2002–2014 period, relative to the modest effect shown in the previous study for the period immediately following the end of the Cold War. However, DRG aid remains effective in the current era under favorable conditions. Further analysis demonstrates important conditional effects related to patterns of DRG investment, such that aid has greater impact when levels of security assistance are low (indicating competing priorities) and when prior DRG investment is low (indicating diminishing returns). In addition, DRG is more effective at intermediate levels of democratization and less so in contexts of democratic backsliding.",

      "Key Findings": "-Sixty-two universities and research institutions became members of the HUC. This outcome exceeded the end target value. As detailed on the ICIMOD website, HUC full members include: 5 from Afghanistan, 4 from Bangladesh; 2 from Bhutan; 14 from China, 18 from India, 3 from Myanmar, 6 from Nepal and 8 from Pakistan (total of 60); and associate members are: 1 from Australia, 2 from Austria, 1 from Mongolia, 2 from Netherlands, 2 from Norway, 1 from Switzerland, 1 from Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, 1 from Thailand, 2 from UK and 4 from the USA (total of 17).\n\n-An information-sharing platform, HUC Online Portal, was established. A consultant company was contracted to develop an interactive website with a searchable database of HUC member profiles and a prototype of an E-Digest. \n\n-The HUC Secretariat reported that 14 grant applications were selected as an achievement of the end target (4). The indicator was intended to foster collaboration, but this was mostly used to support individual conference participation.\n\n-According to ICIMOD’s completion report, 5 study tours were arranged, including 2 visits by the HUC Secretariat to Bhutan and Bangladesh. Study tour participants were expected to be selected from HUC members rather than the HUC Secretariat. \n-Sixty nine percent of the end target value (35) was achieved. Two workshops were conducted for a total 24 librarians and IT staff from HUC member universities in Bhutan (March 2017) and Bangladesh (May 2017).\n\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "ICIMOD, with over 30 years of experience as a learning and knowledge-sharing center, has made HUC its sixth Regional Program. The Grant activities benefitted from the HUC and ICIMOD’s long trusted track record. As a result of the Grant, the HUC now has 60 partner institutions, the partnership has been built and strengthened, and the Secretariat has improved project management capacity. It is beneficial for a small grant activity to build on an existing trusted organization’s record.\n- IT technology is a fundamental means to establish and maintain partnerships, particularly during the current COVID-19 pandemic circumstances. An interactive website with searchable database and Edigest can be a useful tool to foster collaboration of researchers. However, constant maintenance and update of the information of the website is a must to motivate users to stay engaged. For that, researchers could be contractually obliged to update material regularly for posting to the website and librarians and IT could be trained together to update website information and notify users.\n- Adequate supervision budget should be provided for Small Grant activities despite their relatively small financing size. Adequate supervision budget to fund the Bank’s team efforts helped ensure project quality and sustainability.\n",

      "Key Findings": "-Success in removing structural barriers to the innovation process, including amended rules and regulations and the provision of market incentives. Regulatory changes have emerged in the areas of bioenergy, heating, electricity, driving and smart grids, solar PV, and biofuels.\n\n-Knowledge sharing and cooperation. The Green Deals have generated added value for participants by stimulating agreements on knowledge-sharing, cooperation, and networking, as well as taking concrete steps toward trialing and piloting projects.\nThey have also added significant value in disseminating expertise, experience, and best practices, which has led to the emergence of communities of practice or living labs.\n\n-Awareness and political buy-in. The Green Deals have contributed to sustainability and green growth by placing key topics on the agenda in various domains of society and at various levels of government, which has created greater awareness and political buy-in.\n\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "1.Testbeds may be more feasible to implement than sandboxes.\nThe rigidities imposed by the LAC legal system, which follows the civil law tradition and emphasizes the systematic codification of the general law, mean, in some cases, having to seek parliamentary approval to be able to offer regulatory wavers. \n\nTaking the issue of legal rigidities into account, Argentina and Uruguay are discussing the possibility of drafting ‘blanket regulations’ to enable the creation of sectoral sandboxes.\nOther countries should consider revising their regulatory frameworks to facilitate the implementation of experimental schemes.\n2. The international examples show that both approaches are implemented, in practice, in variety of ways and include a series of complementary supports.\nThey act as one-stop shops for information and advice on existing regulation, provide temporary exemptions, offer funding for (collaborative) research and innovation projects, provide access to testing facilities, and promote networking and knowledge sharing.\n\n3. The multi-sectoral nature of some innovations requires coordinated action by actors and regulators.\nThis may call for a multi-sectoral governance mechanisms and/or the leadership of an organization with a supra-national mandate. \n\n4. Regulators should remain neutral, at arms’ length from the private sector.\nRegulatory sandboxes could, for example, work with licensing companies only, or with approved technologies that need further adaptation and enhancement to operate in real settings (as in the NHS program). \n\n5. Innovation agencies are key players in the innovation ecosystem, with good knowledge of innovators and innovation processes, which tend to be perceived as neutral agents (with an independent role). \n\n\n",

      "Document Title": "Research for development in the 21st century",
      "Key Findings": "Since international research projects mainly originate from western countries, a subtle dependency arises between scientists from the Global North coming with their own research agenda and budgets and local scientists from the Global South benefiting, directly or indirectly, from this cooperation. Inevitably, the risk of such a system is to create an unbalanced relationship, which may ignore local priorities. Another mostly invisible aspect of helicopter research refers to the training of Master and PhD students from the Global South on topics which are undoubtedly priorities from the Global North but not necessarily those of their own countries.",
      "Key Recommendations": "International research collaboration is strongly context dependent. Sovereignty should be one of the guiding principles. It is therefore important to respect (1) ethical rules in terms of interest of\nlocal research communities and Indigenous people, and (2) regulations, such as the protocol of Nagoya on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization\n(UN, 2011) and others for the sampling and sending soil samples to a laboratory in the North when there are no analytical possibilities in their country of origin. This is especially important in developing\ncountries with a colonial history. \n\nThe grand challenges of our time require rapid, profound transformations in soil management practices and in our approach to research and training. The Covid-19 crisis has proven to be a pressure cooker for more inclusive approaches to teaching and international exchange through virtual lecturing, webinars and even free conferences including participants from developed and developing countries. We should take advantage of this crisis to adopt such technologies for more inclusiveness in global research collaboration.\n\nAs radical transformations are needed to adapt to global threats, lessons are also to be learned from developing countries. A typically example is the highly efficient management of the Covid-19 epidemic crisis in Asia as compared to Europe and America. Therefore, international collaborations, in particular South-South collaboration and South-North collaboration are extremely important. Researchers from the Global North should acknowledge that since the establishment of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), all nations can be considered as developing countries, as a country may be rich in terms of GDP, but may fail to reach environment-related SDGs. In the 21st century, a global focus on development is tempting as it offers opportunities for addressing universal issues such as climate change, food security, etc. holistically. \n\n",

      "Key Findings": "Over decades, WHEAT has catalyzed a global network of R&D that has delivered and continues to deliver a disproportionate wealth of outputs in relation to investment.\n\nThe network of partners might be scale free – i.e., driven by preferential attachment or the rich-get-richer, with implications for (1) inclusiveness – it may be hard for outsiders to enter the network, and (2) resilience – the system is resilient to random perturbation, but vulnerable to disruption of large nodes such as the centralized breeding system.\n\nGender is used as a research focus, and gender is used to identify a research or capacity development beneficiary; gender achievements in research, while often notable, were often siloed.\n\nCGIAR approved WHEAT’s approach to Youth (along with gender) and results on youth reflect that agreement, with a notable achievement in 2017 that informs youth oriented R4D.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Support strategic investment in network development and maintenance.\n\nInvestigate the nature of the network using larger samples and complementary metrics beyond authorship. Use this information to ensure network resilience in response to both random and targeted disruptions. Consider opportunities for expanding networks beyond current nodes.\n\nIndicators and other approaches that use quantitative data need to continue, as they are expected and considered necessary by most donors. Reducing the focus on these, and increasing the use of case studies (which include numbers and words, or statistics and narratives) that focus on countries or themes (e.g. Ethiopia or mechanization) will likely bring broader perspectives and a more informed (deeper) understanding of WHEAT’s outcomes, and its effectiveness.

While SDG3 focuses directly on promoting, improving, and sustaining health globally, the other SDGs do the same albeit indirectly. SDG17 is important in calling for global partnerships to facilitate the achievement of the other 16 goals including SDG3.\nThis paper has provided an overview of the SDGs, explored the\npower differences at play between potential research partners from HIC and LMIC, examined the social determinants for health and global disease burdens of LMIC, discussed global health research partnerships, and attempted to make a case for community-based participatory research (CBPR) as a viable option for global health research partnerships in the context of the SDGs.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Global health research partnerships need to be developed taking full cognizance of the differences in the social determinants of health of the partners, including the sociocultural and political contextual environment of the research location. These considerations should ideally assist in prioritizing research focus area(s) to meet the specific needs and aspirations of LMIC communities, increase research relevance, and optimize the long-term impact of findings.",

These results are not surprising since: i) firms conducting intramural research may find it easier to protect the knowledge they generate, thus limiting diffusion, and ii) firms conducting research in collaboration with research centers may produce more generic, less specific knowledge that is more easily applicable outside the firm and thus more prone to generate spillovers.\n\nSpillover effects are nonlinear according to the share of firms in the sector-region receiving treatment, leading to an inverted-U shaped relationship. When a firm receives a matching grant, it may have two different effects on other firms in the same sector and region. If there are knowledge spillovers, grants can increase the productivity of non-treated firms. But treated firms may also gain a competitive advantage, displacing demand from rival non-treated firms. Our results suggest that when the share of treated firms is small, the positive knowledge spillover effect dominates. \n",
      "Key Recommendations": "First, the fact that an R&D subsidy increases productivity of direct beneficiaries is not enough to justify the subsidy. Interventions are needed to help overcome market failures which, in this case, consist of knowledge spillovers associated with R&D investments.\nSecond, at least in one of the programs, these positive knowledge spillovers are in fact present. Firms that invest in innovation do not always reap the full benefits of their investment. Therefore, matching grants should be used to promote knowledge creation and increase productivity.\nThird, not all matching grants are created equal. Our results suggest that programs that stimulate collaborative R&D are more likely to generate spillovers than those stimulating\nR&D solely within the firm. Thus, innovation policy designs that encourage research collaboration between firms and universities or technological institutes should be preferred over those that subsidize intramural R&D.\nLastly, beyond some threshold, the intensity of the intervention becomes counterproductive, as business stealing effects dominate knowledge spillover effects. This suggests that it is better to spread matching grants across sectors and regions rather than focus all resources in specific sector-region pairs.",

      "Key Findings": "1. Research: \nThere are strong research centers and research consultancy firms particularly in Hanoi that focus on applied research including air pollution, climate change, innovation, and water resources conservation. These centers include the Air Pollution and Climate Change Research Center, the Green Innovation and Development Centre, and the Center for Water Resources Conservation and Development, and the Centre for Sustainable Development of Water Resources and Climate Change Adaptation. Some Non-Government Organizations (NGOs) and other practitioners have in-house research teams and receive competitive external funding. There was a reported need to further strengthen the quality of research done by Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). Regarding gender considerations in higher education, the Vietnamese government encourages female participation in public/technical service in general. There is a high level of female faculty participation in research: female academic staffing levels range between 40% and 70%.\n\n2. Research translation: \nBoth central and local governments are involved in the identification of research issues, the dissemination of research findings, and the implementation of the recommendations from the research findings. HEI and other researchers submit reports with recommendations to the government, but they leave it up to the government to implement the recommendations. There is no follow-up mechanism to ascertain if recommendations were implemented. There is minimal involvement from NGOs, development partners, and the private sector in the translation (application or uptake) of research. Donor-supported research partnerships are chiefly funded through Asian development agencies, with Japan serving as the main funding agency for research/translation in Vietnam. Other agencies that support research translation include USAID, and some European Union donors. There are more incentives to publish, compared with applying research findings to recommendations for policy or practice. Some peer-reviewed publications attract up to $1,000 USD per paper paid as a bonus that faculty receive for publishing.\nResearchers are hesitant to interact with media out of concern that their findings will be misrepresented or unwelcomed by the government. Some researchers mentioned that they have a hard time summarizing their findings into concise pieces that are accessible to the general population. \n\n3. Collaborations between practitioners and academics: \nThere are no guidelines on collaboration between practitioners and HEIs. Nonetheless, some practitioner organizations collaborate regularly with Vietnamese researchers. Practitioner organizations tend to contract individual academics as consultants, instead of through contracts with universities because of perceived bureaucracy, and issues of government control over public HEIs.\n\n4. Continuity and sustainability of research: \nThe Vietnamese government is the biggest funder of research for public universities. Within some universities, like the Hanoi University of Science and Technology, for-profit companies are registered to facilitate the generation of resources for the universities. These companies manage the intellectual property, estates including housing and property management, students, and university services provided to external clients, including consultancies. Most universities visited are members of Asian Universities Network where universities share opportunities including capacity building, financial support, and student exchange programs.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. For effective implementation of research recommendations, researchers should actively participate and follow up on the recommendations they have developed in the course of their research. Given the researcher’s role in generating these recommendations, it is critical they work with the government to ensure proper interpretation and implementation. \n2. Networking, especially among women leaders and women faculty, should be implemented by institutions in Vietnam as part of mentorship, role modeling, and capacity-building. Presence of female role models within HEIs and the general community should be used to catlyze the agency of women and girls to pursue an advanced career, including research-oriented positions. These female role models should serve as champions to challenge some of the social and cultural norms that hinder full female participation in research. \n3. Incentives to engage in research translation by academic faculty should be expanded to include partnerships, collaboration, program and policy influence. \n4. The current research translation is more inclined to working with government, but Vietnamese researchers should widen this scope by working with other practitioners like local and international NGOs, development partners, and the private sector. Researchers need to actively involve themselves in the work of development practitioners by working with them during the development and through the implementation of their strategies.\n",

To connect the science and the practice of scaling, there is a need to develop complexity-aware models that can guide operational and strategic decision-making on scaling of innovation in R4D. Scaling Readiness incorporates key concepts and measures to: (1) characterize innovation systems, R4D interventions and their scaling goals, and innovation packages; (2) diagnose the scaling readiness of innovation packages as a function of their innovation readiness and innovation use; (3) support strategy development to overcome the main bottlenecks for scaling; (4) guide stakeholder agreement and coalition formation for scaling strategy implementation; and (5) navigate R4D interventions in effective scaling action through reflexive monitoring and adaptive management. In doing so, Scaling Readiness has the potential to enhance the scaling performance of R4D interventions and can support portfolio management of innovations and scaling investments.",

It touched the research lives of hundreds of scholars and changed the research environment even at institutions where research had not previously been a priority. All this, while also pursuing innovative research on five priority issues for Indonesian development. SHERA cannot be assessed by a single measure but must be seen as the complex whole that it has been.\n\nAnd even with its shortened time frame, SHERA has established several important facts. First, with the right supports, a wide range of Indonesian HEIs succeeded in diving into significant, world-class research. Second, despite initial fears, Indonesian HEIs worked well together in these endeavors, sharing resources and finding mutual benefit. Third, building the scaffolding and relationships to undertake such research is a lengthy process, but provides a good return on this investment. Fourth, Indonesian HEIs have much to contribute to the development challenges facing the nation. Fifth, there is much to be gained by building even more comprehensive partnerships between U.S. and Indonesian HEIs.",
      "Key Recommendations": "\n-Devote at least six months to CCR formation and mentoring, as essential part of the process, before proceeding to projects \n• Clarify expectations for role of Lead, Affiliate, and U.S. partners in designing research \n• Spend some time discussing and practicing financial accountability requirements, as well as basis for disbursing funds \n• Develop risk mitigation and crisis management strategies for early termination and other unexpected events \n• More mentoring on managing multi-institution consortia \n• More mentoring on HEIs working with public and private sector organizations \n• More mentoring on developing partnerships with U.S. institutions \n• Bring senior executive managers at Lead institutions into the process of improving research policy \n• More mentoring on how to manage different policies and procedures across participating institutions \n• More mentoring on using IT to enhance communications among members of the CCR \n• More mentoring on selecting which research projects to pursue, including how many can be managed and how to find connections among varying research interests \n• More and earlier mentoring on sustainability planning for when the original funding ends \n• Ask participants at program events to complete event evaluation forms \n• Develop lines of communication with U.S. partners, to discuss program goals and solicit their evaluation of program progress \n\n",

      "Key Findings": "In examining the key features of the ecosystem and comparing them to successful innovation hubs elsewhere, the primary tendency that emerges is a disconnection of actors in the Vietnamese ecosystem. Many startups serve a market of small and medium-sized enterprises, but that relationship is often one-way, with little feedback sought by or offered to the startup. Large domestic enterprises rarely acquire startups; instead, they invest in them primarily as a matter of social responsibility than of market imperative. Foreign tech companies offer little in terms of technology transfer or transformative development of a foundational innovation workforce. Government programs are too often built on a supply rather than a demand basis, offering support that is not much wanted or that adds little value. Academic research lacks links to market application or need. There are exceptions to all of these features, but the general tendencies remain.\nThe legal and regulatory framework is improving, but major challenges remain, particularly with respect to the investment and business environment, intellectual property, the uncertain environment for fintech, and use of data. Some of these issues create significant barriers to progress.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Support to the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI) and other GVN stakeholders on legal and regulatory reform. The issues described in the Legal and Regulatory Enabling Environment section are complex and involve many stakeholders, including multiple GVN and local government stakeholders with interests that potentially oppose one another. \nInstitutional support to the National Innovation Center. The National Innovation Center (NIC) is MPI’s flagship program to support the innovation ecosystem. It has resources and a great deal of ambition, but its agenda is still emerging and is not well connected to the needs of stakeholders. Support could include:\nBuilding an advisory structure rooted in the ecosystem. Assembling a diverse advisory board for the NIC and, to the extent legally possible, giving it a role in the Center’s governance would put diverse stakeholder perspectives at the heart of the initiative. Board members would represent expertise and experience from across the ecosystem and could be selected to ensure an inclusive range of voices. \nDeveloping an HCD-based strategic planning process. USAID could support a more responsive NIC by providing technical and material support to a NIC strategic planning process that is based on HCD principles, convening diverse stakeholders, and designing feedback mechanisms so that the connection to stakeholders is maintained. \nBuilding capacity for leadership and staff. Training and mentoring leadership and staff of the NIC could provide them with tools to better understand the drivers of the innovation ecosystem, effectively engage with stakeholders, and track and adapt to changes in performance indicators.

It also reflects key factors influencing PQHIA practice and uptake of HIA outcomes: costs for participation, HIA knowledge and interest of stakeholders, social responsibility of policymakers, existing policies, data availability, citizen participation, multi-level stakeholder engagement and multi-sectoral coordination. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "The framework suggests that factors necessary to complete a participatory HIA are the same needed to re-integrate HIA results back into the society. There are three different areas that can act as facilitators to PQHIAs: good governance, evidence-based policy making, and access to resources. \n\nParticipatory quantitative models need to be contextually developed and integrated if they are to provide health benefits and be beneficial for the participants. This integration can be facilitated by investing in opportunities that fuel good governance and evidence-based policy making.",

      "Key Findings": "Findings indicate political history plays a significant role in shaping community action. In Somerville, community organizers worked with city and state officials, and embraced community development strategies to engage residents. In contrast, Chinatown community activists focused on immediate resident concerns including housing and resident displacement resulting in more opposition to local municipal leadership.\n\nWe found the ISF to be a helpful framework for organizing assessing activities related to dissemination activities associated with research translation. In order to support the needs of community partners, Prevention Synthesis and Translation System, CAFEH conducted community outreach through English language classes, press releases, community forums, and neighborhood meetings. They also employed educational materials for local dissemination to stakeholders from various community sectors including residents. Despite the benefits of these initiatives, the absence of an internal communications strategy for the dissemination plan was a limitation.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "The current study has important implications for public\nhealth action. Public health practitioners need to be\naware of the of the diverse sectors that comprise communities\nas well as interests, priorities and politics both across and with factions of the community. Moving forward, conducting power analyses in the community using a community organizing framework would be beneficial.",

      "Key Findings": "\"Findings: EQ 1 (Policy Frameworks)PRSSP themes on nutrition and food security were\nincorporated in the 2015 National Nutrition Policy (NNP) and 2018 National\nAgricultural Policy (NAP). \n\nFindings:\nEQ 2 (CIP)The background research papers produced by IFPRI and collaborators\nand presented by IFPRI at the Bangladesh Food Security Investment Forum “were\nthe foundation” of the draft CIP -1. PRSSP did not play a major role in CIP-2\nbut contributed mostly behind the scenes through its research, stakeholder\nconsultations, and inputs on plan content. \n\nFindings:\nEQ 3 (Policy Outcomes) Key informants were universally familiar with PRSSP\npolicy research and dissemination events, mostly familiar with its technical\nreports, and reasonably familiar with its policy briefs. \n\nFindings:\nEQ 4 (APSU)The APSU has demonstrated its capacity by conducting research\nactivities and providing advisory services for the MOA with IFPRI support.\n\nFindings:\nEQ 5 (Institutional Capacity Building)Around 90 percent of the 2,880 people\ntrained by PRSSP were survey supervisors and enumerators but mid and\nsenior-level GOB officials and field-level agents were also included. \n\nFindings:\nEQ 6 Data collected in the most recent ZOI survey closely follow FTF survey\nguidance and are comparable to the standard FTF ZOI survey design, protocols,\nquestionnaires, indicator and covariate definitions and calculations, and\nreport tables\"",
      "Key Recommendations": "Develop a sustainability plan for the APSU and provide it bridge funding until it can transition to a more stable source of financing, likely some combination of GOB and external funding. The sustainability plan should include, a timeframe for the approval of a revised organogram, staff recruitment rules, short and long-term funding strategy. \n2. In the process of securing staff and funding for the APSU, incorporate conditions in any agreement with the GOB that provides guarantees for staff stability to minimize rotation in and out of the unit. \n3. For any follow-up activity, include a wider diversity of national policy actors, including an expanded set of GOB ministries; mid-level and field-level policy actors and implementers; CGIAR members; National Agricultural Research System (NARS) institutions; BARC; National Nutrition Council. \n4. For any follow-up activity, expand policy research and analysis activities to a larger number of sectors and policy areas, including fisheries and livestock, with an emphasis on aligning research activities with USAID/Bangladesh’s FTF activity portfolio. \n5. For any follow-on activity, structure the contract to facilitate greater coordination between the implementer and the Mission FTF activity portfolio to ensure that research and policy analysis address identified policy constraints facing the Mission’s FTF activities. \n6. Develop a BIHS sustainability plan that includes funding and human resources to ensure its maintenance, provide limited capacity assistance for those using the dataset, and update it periodically This may involve formally handing the dataset over to another national entity, such as the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS). \n\n",

      "Key Findings": "The results of the evaluation are mixed. The qualitative research team found effects of the program on policy and programming, academic output, production of academic output, and career advancement of both researchers and students. Analysis of the quantitative data did not produce such results. \nPEER grantees are 10 percent more likely to have received a promotion, an increase in salary, or an additional paid or advisory role compared to PEER applicants that did not receive funding. This result could reveal an element of prestige and respect gained by PEER researchers. PEER researchers have the ability to purchase high-quality equipment, bring in funding from the United States, and collaborate with U.S. government-funded researchers to produce high-quality output. \nThere is, however, a negative relationship between participation in the PEER program and the production of technology or patents. This could be due to the focus of the research selection process on development and policy-related issues. In addition, the focus of the PEER program activities may have prioritized policy-related output over technology or patent production. \nOur inability to detect an effect in the quantitative analysis on the other indicators including academic output, policy impact, receiving additional funding, or other capacity building outcomes could imply that there is truly no effect of the program on these indicators. Another explanation is that there is a true effect but that we do not have sufficient statistical power to detect it. We explore both possible explanations in the conclusions section.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Support principal investigators (PIs) to form policy suggestions that would have a greater success of uptake. This could include advocating policy suggestions on behalf of the PI or providing training to PI’s on how to translate scientific data into policy briefs. \nA USAID or government collaborator could participate in the proposal and research design to ensure there is overlap between relevant data and development goals within the country to create effective policy and programming, or to message evidence for policy and programming more effectively to local stakeholders.\nBase PEER calls for proposals on USAID’s Country Development Cooperation Strategy (CDCS) for the country to increase research utility.\nFor research projects with the highest policy relevance, work with host governments and, if funding is available, leverage government research dollars for PIs to sustain or build upon their research post-PEER. \nSupport governments in their capacity to analyze data in order to create effective evidence-based policy. \nCreate a research database hosted by Missions that would include a contact directory where other researchers could find out what work was done within their specific field. \nRevise the PEER Program Theory of Change to more fully integrate the role that policy-makers play in achieving the program goal of improved development outcomes through their need for, access to, and utilization of research outputs. \nRefine outcome variables for future evaluations. This evaluation included a large number of dependent variables, some were not necessarily aligned with PEER programming. \nRevisit a PEER evaluation after all cycles are complete.",

      "Key Findings": "Our gap analysis identified eight gaps leading to a portfolio of five actions needed to enhance the role of circular bioeconomy in SSA. Applying an outcome tracking approach to data that came from secondary sources, we showed that circular bioeconomy interventions led to ten outputs that translated into five economic, social, and environmental outcomes, including crop productivity, food security, resource use efficiency, job creation, and reduction in GHG emissions. We also identified institutional factors that facilitated the development of outputs and delivery of outcomes. Further, we identified gaps in the outputs and proposed a portfolio of actions needed to harness the full circular potential of biological resources and enhance the role of circular bioeconomy in SSA.\nWhile this article is based on IITA’s experience in SSA implementing circular bioeconomy interventions, the results prove useful as a foundation to develop a framework to guide circular bioeconomy R4D work at IITA and other institutions working in SSA.\n\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "Our study’s contributions are limited to examining cases of circular bioeconomy interventions that aimed to produce food, feed, fuel, and fertilizers at a small scale. Further research is needed to examine their feasibility at commercial scales. Research is also needed to explore the technical feasibility of producing high-value products (e.g., biobased chemicals and polymers) that can be used as building blocks for further processing into bio-based products in the manufacturing industry. \n\nThe technical and commercial feasibilities of high-value products (e.g., herbicides, biopesticides, food additives, detergent, and cosmetics) are demonstrated in different African countries. Applying multiple methods on a collection of abstracts from over 53 thousand academic articles covering technologies, applications, and products for bio-based wastes, a study identified many value path potentials for secondary organic resources beyond energy and fertilizers.\n\nFurthermore, our study relied on cases of circular bioeconomy interventions that focused on independent value chains rather than value webs. In other words, there are no links within and between the considered cases of value chains based on the principle of cascading use and joint use of biomass. Future research should determine how a biomass value web can be created to achieve system optimization in line with the experience of the Biomass Web project implemented in Ethiopia, Ghana, and Nigeria.\n\n",

      "Key Findings": "Network coordination of organizationally independent\nagricultural research units are feasible and produce desirable\neffects.\nThe donors collaborating in the Consultative Group have made a noteworthy advance in practical international cooperation.\nOpportunities might well be examined for extension of this precedent to other areas of research and technical assistance.\nMost of the apparent avenues for operational interrelationship have been pursued with substantial effectiveness in the maize network if the segment examined for this study is indicative.\nThe organizational and technological means are available to assist developing countries to accomplish major increases in maize production, with improved food value.\nMuch of the earlier international cooperation in maize research and much of the strength of the current structure has resulted from the collaborative impulse of researchers functioning through the informal international scientific fraternity.",
      "Key Recommendations": "The financial sponsors and administrators should recognize the contribution of the \"old boy network\" and facilitate its extension and operation. Continuing efforts should be made by those involved to further refine and extend the agricultural research and technical assistance networks, building on the comprehensive system already functioning, with A.I.D. having a major opportunity and responsibility.",

The participating African governments were not. However, U.S. universities tend to lead to individuals overinvesting in education when work experience matters more. Repatriation of scholars/students is difficult, especially in cases where the home country is in turmoil.\n\nThere is a demand for post-secondary, technical, non-degree training that is not well addressed in current programs.\n",

      "Key Findings": "1. Borrower: The Government of Pakistan. The program will be executed by the Agricultural Research Council which is charged with the responsibilities for stimulating, promoting, and coordinating agricultural research in Pakistan.\n\n2. Loan Amount: $7, 600, 000\n\n3. Terms: Repayment in 40 years, including 10-year grace; 2% during\nthe grace period and 3% thereafter.\n\n4. Purpose: To upgrade and expand Pakistan's agricultural research\ncapability, both national and provincial, to effectively deal with problems in priority commodity/crop areas so as to increase agricultural production for domestic consumption and exports.\n\n5. Project Description: A five-year program to develop and upgrade\nPakistan's agricultural research institutes and colleges and to establish\nand equip a National Research Center to coordinate and carry out priority research projects. Commodities, expatriate technical advisors (including intermediaries), and academic and practical training for\nprofessionals and sub-professionals will be financed over a five-year period. An evaluation system, including workshops and an evaluation panel, will permit the assessment of research work undertaken and implementation progress.\n\n6. Total Costs: The total cost of the expanded research program is estimated at $19. 6 million, of which $9. 6 million is for foreign exchange costs and $10. 0 million for local currency costs. Of the foreign exchange costs, 30/ is for commodities, 42% for technical advisory assistance, and 28% for training.\n\n7. Other Sources of Financing: The agricultural research program has been discussed with other multilateral and bilateral donors including IBRD, FAO, UNDP, Ford, and Rockefeller Foundation. It is clear from these discussions that while other multilateral donors will continue contributing in modest way as they have been in the past, they are not in a position to make the major input required and which has been requested of AID.",
      "Key Recommendations": "It is recommended that a loan to the Government of Pakistan be authorized in the amount of $7. 6 million to finance the foreign exchange costs of U. S. and Code 941 category country procurement of commodities, technical assistance, and training on the following terms and conditions:\n(a) Repayment will be made in US dollars within 40 years from the date of the first disbursement with a 10-year grace period.\n(b) Interest at the rate of 2% per annum during the 10-year grace period and 3% per annum thereafter.\n(c) This loan shall be subject to such other terms and conditions as set forth in Section XI of this paper.",

      "Key Findings": "1The evaluation team concludes that the \"Project under the Loan agreement is, in general, soundly conceived, and is consistent with current and long-range national goals for strengthening the research capability for overall improvement in the agricultural sector.\n\nThe program of work called for under the Loan Agreement is\nvery ambitious. It would have required a high level of performance even by a fully-staffed ARC (Agricultural Research Council) to have completed all the activities as proposed. To complicate matters, a number of unanticipated problems arose which have had the effect\nof materially delaying the implementation of planned activities. Several parts of the Project are about two years behind schedule. But commendable actions have been accomplished in initiating four major national research schemes, in preparing for the implementation of other national schemes, and in proceeding with the acquisition of about 1500 acres of land for a national agricultural research center.\n\nSeveral unforeseen events have contributed to slow progress in\nprograms under the Loan Agreement: i. Director General position was vacated just prior to the signing of the Loan Agreement. The Deputy Director-General was made working as Director and has continued in this role. ii. lack of staffing in ARC in general, and in the administrative services side in particular. iii. Problems regarding the acquisition of land for the Agricultural Research Center.\n\nARC is to be commended for moving ahead in the development of national research programs. other important measures are i) arrangements to fill the post of DG in near future ii) provisions to consolidate key staff offices in Islamabad iii) appointment of important supporting administrative staff, including a procurement officer iv. acquisition of land for PARC.",
      "Key Recommendations": "The Review Team r~ommend8 that the Agricultural Research Loan Project be continued without modification for one additional\nyear in order to permit the Agricultural Research Council to implement more fully the provisions of the agreement. Continuance or modifications in the Loan Agreement after this additional year should be based on the degree to which deficiencies described in this report are corrected.\n\nTop priority should be given to the appointment of a Director General with the qualifications necessary to provide strong leadership both as a manager and scientist to make ARC fully effective as an operating organization.\n\nArrangements should be completed for the appointment of a Research advisor with the necessary qualifications as a scientist and also, experience in both management and administration of a research entity.\n\nThe appointment of coordinators required for research projects\nalready approved under the loan agreement program should proceed\nforthwith. \n\nEmphasis should be placed on developing effective organizational\narrangements, including clear statements of responsibility.\n\nThe make-up of the ARC Executive Sub-committee is unwieldy in numbers and ineffective in action. The number of members should be reduced and a Steering Committee formed to make it more efficient and effective. \n\nAppointment of a full-time training officer in ARC.\n\nEstablishment within ARC of a procurement cell headed by a procurement officer responsible to the Director of Administrative Services, or the equivalent in the ARC organization.\n\nARC, in consultation with AID and others,  re-assess the need for expatriate technicians during the remaining period under the Project.\n\nUrgent attention should be given to the construction of staff\nhouses.",

The Research Director at IUT indicated also that representatives from IBM were particularly impressed by the techniques developed for storing and retrieval of so much and so varied data on such a small machine (IBM 1130). \n",
      "Key Recommendations": "Propose a leas ambitious goal, e.g. the training of Africans\nin applied research techniques, use of computers in social science\nresearch, exposure to computer operations, computer programming, primary\nresearch design, statistics and behavioral analyses, under the supervision\nof experts in these fields. In time, and with continuing exposure to\nand use of the above in research projects (not necessarily of the dimensions\nor in the fields suggested by the governments for their development\nplans), expatriates will be replaced In their supervisory/administrative\ncapacities. In the meantime, Africans will be prepared to assume Intermediate\nlevel positions. See recommendation #5 below.\n\nWhere a choice is to be made between Institute or University\n(University faculty) funding it seems that funding of the Institute to\ncontinue to do more of what it is already organized to do would produce\nfaster, more efficient results. A blending of the two research orientations\ncould result from the use of University faculty and graduate students in\nInstitute sponsored research.\n\nProgram emphasis should be on training faculty, rather than\nstudents. See recosmendation #5 below\n\nGive grant assistance to those countries whIch have fewer\nresources available, using, for example, the World Brink figures of\n$150.00 per capita to determine which countries fall within this definition.\n",

EMBRAPA today is on its way to obtain the  so-desired modernization of the agriculture which is based on the development of science and technology. EMBRAPA could assimilate the technology used especially in the United States of America and in other countries where technicians, under the resources of this Loan, participated in international conferences, seminars, technical meetings and workshops.",

Although no logframe is part of the project\ndocumentation, the following logframe elements are constructed from the available documentation:\n\n1. Goal: Improved rural development policies and programs.\nNo data were reviewed to estimate the contribution of ADC fellows\nto this goal.\n\n2. Purpose: To increase the competence of Asians to deal with the\neconomic and human problems of agricultural and rural development in\ntheir own countries. The ADC prepared biographical statements on a stratified sample of\n26 of the 51 fellows who have completed their training under the grant.\nAll the fellows were selected from university, government or other\ninstitutional positions where they had demonstrated the potential to make\na much more significant contribution in their fields if they could receive\nPh.D. training.

The approach adopted\nby PCARR in bringing together selected stations with certain\ndegrees of research capability and developing them into research\ncenters appear to be the most logical and practical solution.\nUpgrading is being undertaken in terms of improving the research\nlaboratories, fields, equipment, and personnel, as well as\nmanagement procedures. The development of such technology generating centers in the rural areas is the most rational companion-program to the government development approach based on the concept of regional development all both a goal and a means to national development. As organized, the national and regional research\ncenters already operational under the leadership of PCARR are\nbeginning to take a lead role in both the formulation and execution of the research programs which are aimed at backstopping the agricultural development programs of the regions as coordinated under the guidance of the National Economic and Development Authority with which PCARR has established a close relationship.\n\nThe proposed loan project together with the first loan will place\nin position ten such research centers to play the development role\nintended for them. These represent about two-thirds of the 16\nresearch centers being developed in the PCARR station for\nthe decentralization of the research effort. With the increasing\nsupport the Philippine Government is providing PCARR in the\nmodernization of the agricultural research system, the viability\nof the project is believed assured.",
      "Key Recommendations": "The past practice of increasing food production by increasing the land area tilled can no longer be pursued.

      "Key Recommendations": "National Network of Research Centers and Stations\nRecommendation 1:There is confusion in the terminology between regional research centers and the 10 research consortia/ centers. The designation of the centers, consortia, and stations in the National Network should be clarified.\nRecommendation 2. Funds under future loans should be used primarily to support existing or contemplated research programs rather than building infrastructure at additional locations.\nRecommendation 3. PCARR should concentrate research in its national and regional network and should utilize the cooperating stations only when needed to evaluate locally the research conducted at the centers.\nResearch Program Planning and Management\nRecommendation 4. PCARR should develop strong national priority commodity programs through the mechanism of local problem identification, regional priority assessment (with NEDA and the research center leaders), and then national organization, evaluations, and recommendation for funding through the Research Divisions and TPPRB. The Research Divisions and investigation leaders would then be able to initiate, review and assign projects to implementing agencies with minimum review by the TPPRB under the general responsibility of the Director-General and the Governing Council.",

      "Key Findings": "Priority researchable ICP projects are identified for each of the three USAID funding modes, i.e. central bureau funded, regional bureau funded, and Mission funded. Africa has been identified as a priority region because of the consistent food deficits; most African countries are in desperate need of assistance in achieving stabilized crop production and increased productivity of basic food crops. For this reason much of the recommended research is oriented to the problems of African agriculture.\nLinkages and organizational modes are suggested for each type of research and development project. Briefly described is an approach to ICP research and development as well as training components that should be included in each of the recommended projects.",
      "Key Recommendations": "It is suggested that a centrally funded project concerned with ICP research be initiated as a three phased program and which should be maintained on a long term forward funding mode. It is recommended that initially an ICP research project be implemented on humid\nhighland maize, followed by a sorghum-millet project in year three, and finally, by a program dealing with upland rainfed rice in year five.",

The major impacts of ACTI studies seen in this project were the results of studies under taken from one to three years prior to the start of the project. Each new study appears\nto gain impact due to the success of previous studies. Follow-up costs are very high - more than $100,000 in mailings alone each year. Perhaps most important is an entrepreneurial personality for the studies director resulting in extensive, non-formal efforts\nto diffuse the study information.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Under an expanded program, there would have to be a largex: BOSTID staff and, of critical importance to assure quality and credibility, more frequent meetings of the Board itself, coupled with a suitable executive committee or standing committee structure.\n\nIn a new project, there should be an improved financial management system so that personnel costs and indirect costs can be more easily tied to project functions and outputs.\n\nIn view of what may be increased difficulty in locating and attracting the uncompensated S&T experts who would be needed in an expanded program, NAS/BOSTID should consider a more formal system to identify and attract participants.\n\nNAS/BOSTID should intensify use of its newly-designed evaluation system, including increased follow-up visits to workshops and a survey of NRC reviews of ACTI monographs in order to identify measures which would improve quality.\n\nWe believe the NAS overseas grant and contracts management procedures are likely to require careful scrutiny if an expanded program involves subgrants or subcontracting.\n\nThe system of producing and reviewing ACTI reports requires attention so that there is a more rapid completion of reports.",

      "Key Findings": "The University of Michigan has successfully developed the technology necessary for a computerized national health planning model. The Model's greatest potential for immediate impact on LDC health planning lies in its use as a tool for training LDC health planners to think of health sector problems and opportunities in resource allocation terms. Its long-range potential as a planning tool depends on the capability of LDC health managers to deal with quantitative and econometric dimensions and concepts. The technology of the Model itself is in place.",
      "Key Recommendations": "The University of Michigan Model development team should continue upgrading the technology to accommodate extraneous variables. time-phased variables, and optimization. The Model should be adapted for use on a variety of hardware, and in a variety of computer languages, deployed as a planning tool at both national and lower levels of government, and packaged in a core technology transfer curriculum for public health planning, to be delivered in LDCs. AID missions should use the Model to stimulate LDCs to upgrade health sector data and information management systems. ",

      "Key Recommendations": "AID assistance should include operating cost as well as capital cost\nsupport for zonal and national research activities for several years.\nMore needs to be done to sharpen the focus and bring about greater integration of efforts. AID should continue to encourage the evolution of stable policies and institutions which are favorable to agricultural development, particularly those relating to markets and prices for food crops and the availability of agricultural development.\n",

      "Key Findings": "Although this project is only mid-way in its implementation, there are serveral lessons already apparent from experience to date that should be applicable to AID's work in other secotrs and in other countries. First, and most important, institutions are not bult overnight. AID tends to think and plan in terms of acheiving a significant development impact in five years or less. Such an expectation seems unreasonably unrealistic and tends to underrate a project's performance (ie., when judged against an impossible task, actual acheivement cannot help but appear inadequate). If AID is sincere in wanting to make a meaningful and valuable contribution to development, then it must plan accordingly and have the patience and consistency to follow through on its plans. Second, AID should not ask a middleman to do its work for it. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "1) The FRCU should be staffed to a greater extent than present by\nindividuals who can devote their attention and loyalties more fully to\nthe FRCU and its development. These individuals should be willing to accept responsibility and take risks.\n2) A senior-level FRCU staff member should sit with each priority\ncommittee (perhaps 3 committees per staff member) in order to standardize procedures and disseminate innovations more widely.\n3) Measures must be taken to activate all priority committees and\nstimulate acceptable proposals in all priority areas.\n4) The FRCU should continue to improve its communications with\nproposers and should not hesitate to notify a proposer of the rejection\nof his proposal.\n5) The FRCU should establish specific deadlines (perhaps every three or\nfour months) for the submission and consideration of proposals.\n6) Tenure on the priority committees (currently unlimited) should be\ngiven a specific time limit (e.g., two years), and membership should be\nrotated over time so that more individuals who possess certain expertise in their fields have the opportunity to serve on committees.\n7) The first and third quarterly reports required on all research\nshould be very brief (perhaps 5 pages) and should be commented on to the researchers within one week of submission.\n8) The FRCU should request funding at least a quarter in advance of its\nneeds to allow AID sufficient processing time. In addition, AlD should\nalways be in search of ways to minimize its own bureaucracy and\nconsequent delays in processing.\n9) The FRCU should reconsider its definition of capacity building and\nthe presentation of this concept to the universities. Clear and specific\nguidelines should be formulated (and explained to all universities) that\nfocus capacity building on improving the institutional abilities of a\nuniversity to participate in development work in the future.\n10) Efforts should be made to assist professors in a better proposal\npreparation.\n11) AID should not assume that technical assistance always will be needed to assist host country organizations.\n12) ADLI should be reduced to its one Data and Information Advisor, and the other current personnel on the ADLI team should not be extended.\n13) AID should revise the ULP's timetable (retrospectively, if\nnecessa:-y) to reflect more realistic expectations of how swiftly\n\"Institutionalization\" can occur. In addition, AID should continue to be\nprepared for even more delays since institutionalization always may take longer than anticipated.\n14) Several of the top management in the FRQJ should visit the major U.S. granting organizations (e.g., the National Science Foundation, the\nFulbright Commission) for stimulation of ideas and alternatives in\nstructuring and running the FRCU.\n15) In future project designs, AID should reconsider the need for and/or the specified role of technical assistance middlemen.\n",

Research often is done without knowledge of farm problems and needs, extension activities are confined primarily to the introduction of new varieties because other technology does not exist or is not farm tested and the availability of quality inputs is uncertain ot unavailable in the hills. The project as designed addresses these constraints.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Long term institutional development and reorganization is necessary to address these problems. The multiplication of quality seed of high performance varieties  is imperative to the success of agricultural development programs. Institutionalization of this capability must be developed so that management, administration and distribution of quality seed can be done in the hill areas themselves with some AIC participation. Three years of continued support to this activity should be sufficient to institutionalize the system.",

A close relationship between commodity and FSR approaches is essential in order to propose useful recommendations for farmers.\n\nInstitutional, educational and methodological aspects have limited progress of FSR networks.

      "Key Findings": "In the 11 short years of its existence, PCARRD has made significant progress in achieving its objectives. In addition to improving the planning and management of research, it has provided leadership in strengthening the capability of the Philippines to implement research. \n\nThe Review Team feels that PCAARD has utilized Project II funds effectively to achieve the goals of improving the research capability in the Philippines: \n\n1. Agricultural Research Development Projects I and II provided the equivalent of $20.0 million in new infrastructure. As of December 31, 1983, with six months remaining in the project, 58% of the total infrastructure in Project II was completed, 30% ongoing, and only 12% to be implemented or in the bidding/designing/awarding stage.\n2. Since 1976, equipment and library materials worth $4.4 million have been added to agricultural research centers/stations to the PCARRD Secretariat. As of December 31, 1983, 84% of equipment project II\nhad been procured.\n3. Since 1973, when PCARRD started its manpower development program, PCARRD has awarded a total of 820 grants for Philippine degree training -75 B.S., 645 M.S., and 100 Ph.D./DBA. Two-thirds of these were awarded to institutions outside the Manila/Los Banos area. Fifty-six percent of the recipients have graduated and 20 percent are continuing; only 12 percent terminated due to failure to meet standards. International training grants were awarded to 195 researchers and support staff 9 Ph.D. 113 non-degree short-term training, and 73 travel grants for participation in scientific conferences, meetings, and study tours.\n4. The percent of PCARRD-funded research projects outside the Manila/Los Banos area under Project II increased from 23 percent in 1981 to 32 percent in1982 and to 50 percent in1983. And the corresponding 4mount of funds for these projects went from 11 percent in1981 to 41 percent in1982 and 40 percent in1983.",
      "Key Recommendations": "The review team recommends that PCARRD should assist the regional consortia/centers make a critical review of national, regional, and cooperating station commodity assignments and help them in improving research leadership and management capabilities. It should continue to assist in strengthening key national and regional research centers and focus particular attention on Improving the centers' capacity to maintain meaningful regional institutional cooperation through consortia and programs and explore, refine and expand technology dissemination within the comprehensive framework wtich has been so innovatively developed.",

      "Key Findings": "AID-sponsored agricultural policy analysis and planning projects have had a substantial impact on the capacity of host country governments to engage in policy analysis and planning. In fact, capacity-building impacts are, by far, the most prevalent. Fully 36 of the 39 projects have had capacity building impacts as reflected in the qualifications of planning staff and in the quality of analyses and data bases produced by policy analysis and planning offices. \nInter-institutional impacts are observed in just under one half of the projects reviewed (19 of 39 projects). These impacts have resulted from improved coordination between agricultural policy analysts and planners and their counterparts in other public sector agencies or private sector organizations. The major type of inter-institutional impact has been the establishment of an interagency board or commission, which by its nature improves institutional coordination.\nDecision maker impacts are observed in 15 of the 39 projects (38 percent). Decision maker impacts have been quite varied, but the most prevalent has been increased demand for information and analysis by decision makers. The other relatively common impact has been the development of greater understanding by decision makers of the agricultural sector and its relationships with other sectors of the economy. Asian projects have been more successful than African and Near Eastern projects in bringing about decision maker impacts.\n\nPolicy and program impacts are observed in 11 of the 39 projects (28 percent). Such impacts result when AID-sponsored projects contribute to actual changes in policies or programs. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "If AID is to have its support contribute more directly to policy reform and programmatic change, it appears that its approach to and design of policy analysis and planning projects needs to be modified. First, there needs to be more diagnosis of what the major problems of the agricultural sector are and what policies constrain sector development. The diagnosis needs to be done prior to or as part of project design so that projects can be more specific about policy issues to be addressed.\nSecond, policy issues must be gone through in detail with key host country decision makers. Fruitful areas to study should be agreed upon jointly. This is part of the demand baseline strategy suggested in the Latin American and Caribbean study. Greater up-front interaction will help cement host country commitment, which was a source of difficulty in the policy analysis and planning projects reviewed. \nThird, the role of policy analysis must be viewed explicitly as one of contributing to policy deliberations and policy change. While the focus on development of host country capacity should by no means be abandoned, it must be tied into specific policy issues of concern.\nThe overall approach to policy analysis and planning projects should, therefore, be weighted toward: 1) diagnosis of policy problems prior to project implementation; 2) increased interaction with key decision makers; and 3) viewing policy analysis explicitly as leading to policy making.\n",

The management needs for an expanded program are beyond the capability of currently allocated personnel resources. The ASEAN system remains too disjointed to allow for an expanded, yet cost-effective A.I.D.-ASEAN program. \nMany, but not all, of the A.I.D.-ASEAN projects contribute significantly to promotion of regional \ncooperation. The benefits of many of the projects appear to be shared among member countries. Thailand has hosted the most projects and has received the most benefit. Indonesia and the Philippines have benefited more than Singapore and Malaysia. A.I.D. is helping, but not leading, the move toward more regional cooperation through ASEAN. Much of the spontaneous cooperation is occurring in the private sector but this is not attributable to A.I.D. \nA.I.D. support too ASEAN institution-building objectives shows considerable success under current project operations. The potential for continued, viable operations lies with the ability to secure a broad donor base. The ASEAN countries do not appear ready to support regional institutions financially, with exception of the host country. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "The ASEAN program should not be expected to have a direct impact on A.I.D.'s target population. Some projects may accomplish this, but most will help the ASEAN member countries to improve their capability to implement field level development projects. The linkages between the program activities and the eventual desired impact should be as clear as possible. \nFuture regional projects oriented toward institutional development should be linked to existing national institutions and should focus on promoting regional cooperation through development of information networks, seminars, regional centers, and other joint 3ctivities. Regional projects should provide benefits that cannot be obtained in a bilateral program. For training, there is an economic benefit from sharing institutional capabilities among countries rather than each country trying to develop its own high quality capability in every field. ",

      "Key Findings": "Mixed farming is not a tradition and these projects have not made any attempts to introduce it. Hence most farmers will not tend to choose combinations of different agricultural techniques. They will tend to specialize in raising large or small animals or growing crops--- but will not as a whole combine any of these three alternatives. \nKey finding from this study is:\nFirst, decision about adopting new agricultural technologies seem to be determined by both economic and socio-cultural variables. Often because of too much emphasis on narrow expertise in most studies of projects, there is tendency to concentrate on one set of variables at the expense of others. \nSecondly, contrary to the hypothesis that most farmers are totally dominated by their socio-cultural values, it is in fact economic concerns which emerge as the most important determinants of the decisions of the local clients.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Local farmers usually turn out to have sound econimic reasons for adopting or rejecting proposed innovations. Consequently, in cases of project failure the emphasis should not be put on blaming local clients but on the need for serious technical and econimic studies of the proposed innovations in the proper context.",

      "Document Title": "Agricultural Research and Technology Transfer by the Private Sector in India",
      "Key Findings": "1. Private-sector research is growing in India. At least US$18 million were invested in agricultural research by the private sector in 1985. This is about 7 percent of the total agricultural research in India. While most of the private sector research is very applied, some Indian companies are conducting more basic research in the areas of plant biotechnology, agricultural engineering, and poultry breeding\n2. Private research has had an impact on agricultural productivity, but further studies will be required to accurately measure its impact. Private plant breeding has led to private pearl millet hybrids which may cover almost 2 million ha., sorghum hybrids on 200,000 ha., and maize hybrids on 300,003 ha. New breeds of poultry are beginning to have an impact. Feeds research has improved commercial poultry productivity and cut the cost of feed. Pesticide research has increased the spread and productivity of the pesticides used in India.\n3. There is evidence that both the amount and direction of private research have been influenced by government policy. Some companies interviewed suggested that government policy has discouraged local agricultural research. The policy has affected the direction of research. Indian chemical research concentrates on process innovation rather than product innovation. Private seed research is concentrated almost exclusively on hybrid crops because there are no property rights on other crops.\n4. There is more basic research in India than in any of the other countries surveyed. This appears to be mainly due to the scale effect -the Indian market for seeds, pesticides, poultry, and tractors is far larger than any of the other economies surveyed. \n5. AID's most important contribution to private research was providing scholarships to train scientists abroad and helping the agricultural universities. Government and university research has assisted the development of the private sector, and government and university scientists have been hired by the private sector.",
      "Key Recommendations": "AID could assist the private sector by encouraging a better understanding of the government policies that encourage or constrain private research. Conferences and research on this topic could promote policies and government agricultural research that takes advantage of the capacities of the private sector to develop new technology. AID might also be able to encourage private research through competitive research grants to the private research programs or cooperative public-private research projects. Programs like the AID-PACT program that encourages contact between private sector scientists in the U.S. and India may also be useful.",

      "Key Findings": "Agricultural research by the private sector is now between 32 and 40\npercent of the total research conducted in the Philippines, which is only 0.1% of the value of agricultural GDP. The seed industry, pesticide industry, and plantation and processing industries had: the largest\nresearch programs. There was also research in livestock feeds and shrimp production but the quantity is unknown. The major impact of private technology transfer and research has been in the poultry and swine sector and the plantation sector. AID has indirectly supported the development of private research through its support for government research programs, agricultural universities and international agricultural research centers.",
      "Key Recommendations": "There are at least four types of activities that would encourage more private research and technology transfer. First, AID can assist public sector research which will, in turn, induce more private sector research. Public sector research in the Philippines is now in a financial and perhaps an intellectual crisis. It requires continued assistance from AID. This will, in turn, assist private agribusiness -particularly, if government research will open up more to the needs of agribusiness. Some resources might be provided on a competitive grant basis which would be open to private and public sector research organizations.\n\nSecond, AID can assist the universities which educate the scientists\nfor both the private and public research systems. Private sector researchers were educated at Los Banos, USM, and other government universities. Many of them also did graduate work in the United States. There are signs that its human capital is not sufficient to meet the country's needs. A number of companies located regional research programs in the Philippines because of the availability of well-trained scientists and the presence of IRRI and UPLB. The Philippines no longer has the comparative advantage in scientific manpower that it once had over its neighbors. AID assisted in developing scientific manpower to its present level. AID should look for ways it can in which continue to support manpower development.\n",

      "Key Findings": "The research institutions aided by this project have already\nhad some positive impact on small farmers and will have a greater\nimpact in the near future. The economic impacts so far have been in corn, rice, and rubber, and in the next five years there will be significant impacts on sweet potato productivity. The regional institutions are playing an important role in solving regional and national problems. The project contributed to significant increases in sweet potato yields through the introduction of new varieties by the Visayas State College of Agriculture. However, a program for collecting and analyzing data on the impact of new technology as described in the Project Paper was never implemented. Even where accomplishments appear to have been the greatest, as with tobacco and sweet potato, data are not available.",

Estimates for livestock and horticultural crop research programs show a significant positive CGIAR impact as well. National extension spending is also stimulated by CGIAR programs. The study estimates that CGIAR Center programs have had significant impacts on crop productivity for maize, millets, sorghum, rice, wheat, beans, cassava, and potatoes in all the regions studied. National research programs have had a positive impact on crop productivity in most of these crops as well. In addition, national extension programs have been productive in some crops. These estimates are based on crop production data in 25 countries.",
      "Key Recommendations": "A blanket recommendation that all national systems should be expanded without regard to their existing organization and strucutre is not justified by these data. However, an expansion of well-organized systems is called for and the data clearly show the potential for high payoff national system investments in all countries in the developing world.",

      "Key Findings": "1. The project is a success and will achieve its original purpose and outputs by the PACD.  This finding is based on the limited objectives of the original project. It is not a finding based on current AID criteria for ASEAN or other project activities. \n2. The research conducted did not fit current AID criteria for relevance to an area of AID interest.  This finding does not imply that the research done was not generally relevant to development. However, AID has found that best results are obtained by concentrating its resources on a few areas determined in strategy statements to be of AID interest. ISEAS also found it difficult to administer a broad variety of research topics.  AID also wants research it sponsors applied in a reasonable time to development problems. ISEAS is capable of influencing key policy-makers and others affecting development, but could not have had much impact in this area with the diverse research activities under this project. \n3. Training benefits of the project meet the objective of strengthening ASEAN capacities, but were not focused on identified ASEAN needs. This finding is another reflection of the difference between early ASEAN projects and current AID practice. There was no analysis to show need for the training received. \n4. Project costs were only slightly less on a per trainee basis than training in the U.S. \nThe $21,700 per fellowship cost would not be excessive for post-doctoral work of about a year in the U.S., but it is not much lower. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "All concerned in the project --ISEAS management, fellows, and AID project managers --are to be commended on its success.  However, before considering requests for follow-on assistance for ISEAS research, AID and ISEAS should find ways to bring the activity into line with current AID research criteria. \nAID should not support further research in a number of fields of unknown relation to AID strategy. Any follow-on research activity should be based on a topic of AID relevance such as small business development. \nNo future project should be considered as a training activity unless the need for the training is established and the project is focused on that need. \nFuture ASEAN training activities should be closely examined to determine the extent of cost savings over U.S. training.

      "Key Findings": "1. All available evidence indicates that the long-term training element of the project has not accomplished the objectives as set forth in the project documents and will not do so in the future.\n2. After numerous delays, implementation of the management information system (MIS) element of the project appears to be progressing and approaching the point where it can become an effective management tool.\n3. The short-term training element of the project has had many delays and problems for a variety of reasons but is row functioning well and the pace of implementation is increasing rapidly. However, additional inputs of both funds and personnel will be required to meet the desired objectives of institutionalizing training capabilities in the cooperating Ministries.\n4. There have been numerous problems connected with the technical assistance inputs and implementation of the project. Most of these have been resolved, but a few points still need to be clarified.\nIf additional funds are transferred to the short-term training sector, it will be imperative that additional inputs be made to the technical assistance element.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. It is strongly recommended that all uncommitted funds available in the long-term element of the project be transferred to the short-term element where they can be utilized more effectively and that the long-term element is phased out.\n2. It is recommended that every effort be made to complete the input of data to the MIS, to train the staff of the Ministry of Education and Youth (MOEY) at all levels in inputting data, in system maintenance, and in the utilization of the MIS for improved MOEY operations.\n3. A detailed analysis should be made of the present status and operational capabilities of the short-term training element of the project in relation to desired objectives. A detailed operational plan should then be developed to guide the effective utilization of additional inputs.\n4.  A detailed analysis should be made of the technical assistance inputs, counterpart requirements, and logistical support required to effectively implement an expanded short-term training program. A detailed operational plan should then be developed and mutually agreed upon by all participating agencies.",

      "Key Findings": "1. In reference to the projected outputs, significant progress is evident in the rehabilitation of research facilities at the Farm of the Makerere University (MU)/Faculty of Agriculture and Forestry (FAF) (Kabanyolo) and at the Kawanda Research Station of the Ministry of Agriculture (MA). If rehabilitation continues as planned, both should be capable of a reasonable level of operation by the end of the present project in September 1988. Also, at both locations, farm equipment is now arriving so the operation of the farms should be possible by the end of the present phase of the project. The TA Project Staff have carried out their work very well. However, at both locations, there are few if any local funds to support any significant research. Therefore, the actual implementation of research in the short run will be highly dependent upon project and other external funds to meet most of the recurrent expenditures. There have been long delays in procurement of laboratory equipment and supplies by the USAID selected Procurement Services Agency (PSA) and from all reports by project staff and staff of the implementing agencies, the present PSA arrangement is unsatisfactory.\n2. The Rehabilitalitation of teaching facilities at MU/FAF has very little during the life of the project. Rehabilitalitation plans have been drawn and a local contractor is to carry out the work rather than having it done under the supervision of the project personnel.\n3. Rehabilitation, except at the MU/FAF, has progressed very well but there is still much that needs to be done that will not be covered under the present project. For example, there is no rehabilitation now scheduled for the Namulonge Research Station which is to be the main station for annual food crops.\n4. While the rehabilitation has, by and large, been carried out very well and with excellent supervision by the Management Assistants, there is little assurance, at least in the short run, that the implementing agencies will have either the trained manpower or the financial resources to maintain the facilities and equipment. Corrective measures must be taken in the design of the next phase of the project, as well as in negotiations between USAID and the GOU, to assure support for maintenance. This will need to include appropriate salaries to attract and hold the skilled technicians who are required for service and maintenance.\n5. The retraining of staff has been carried out as planned and 32 staff persons from MU/FAF and 35 from the MA have received short-term training in the United States or at one of the IARCs. There has been little follow-up on the trainees since their return from training and the absence of any equipment or financial support for them on their return has negated any hope for early application of knowledge or new capability acquired as part of their training.\n6. The development of a food crop research strategy and implementation of a viable agricultural research program is still in a very preliminary stage. The Agricultural Research Advisor is working closely with the Chief Agricultural Research Officer, who was appointed in the MA as one of the project requirements, to bring about better planning, execution, monitoring, and reporting of agricultural research. \n7. In regard to \"assistance to the MU/FAFW there does not appear to have been any significant action by the Contractor in regard to curricula and staff development plans. Also, there was no action by the Contractor or the FAF on the identification and training of \"Extension Specialists\" for the six departments of the FAF as had been agreed under the project. There is little evidence of any strengthening of linkages between research and extension or between the MA and the MU/FAF.",
      "Key Recommendations": "There is a need to make certain that information concerning the content and scope of the project is well known by all key indiviudals in the implementing agencies; In order to achieve the above, the Evaluation team suggests that in addition to the TA Team Meetings [...] there should be regular joint meetings attended by key individuals (decision makers not just counterparts) and the TA Team Members. \n",

      "Key Findings": "Because of lack of clarity of the Project Paper there were different\nconceptual interpretations about the real meaning and the most effective ways to develop the goal. This, to some extent, may explain that the time and the processes needed to promote and start studies in different countries was underestimated. The Project had a longer incubation period than expected.\nAlthough the total number of studies carried out in the life of the\nProject may even surpass the 40 limit in the Cooperative Agreement, the countries have been reduced to seven and, in each one, several institutions have been involved. ",
      "Key Recommendations": " A.I.D. would be wise to review these projects in an attempt to coordinate their efforts. A review would allow A.I.D. to consider the failures and the accomplishments of these projects in\nthe area of applied research. It might allow for the development of a coherent and organized research policy and for better coordination between the\nprojects. \nThe project will be successful if it is able to generate interest in and research capacity for the study of diarrheal diseases; provide an opportunity for junior researchers to carry out small scale exploratory research leading to more focused context responsive diarrheal control efforts; and bring to completion a group of research project conducted by local investigators in a\nrestricted number of countries.\nThe research themes designated by the\nproject are important and could be expanded to include aspects of prevention, e.g., hand washing, measles vaccination, disposal of fecal material, (etc.), the role of feeding and other aspects of convalescent care.\nThe local investigators should be supported by close association with an established investigator(s) and by careful monitoring by project staff. All projects financed by ADDR should have a demarcated senior investigator, a medical or social scientist, attached and committed to the project as a mentor and consultant.",

      "Key Findings": "\"A. SAFGRAD Coordination Office\n\n1. The SCO has done a good job organizing and implementing\nthe four crop Networks.  \n2. The SCO needs to concentrate its activities and\nconsolidate them around the Networks, and then become known as an\nefficient Network manager. \n3. The SCO needs to be a much more effective fund raiser\nfor its own operations. \n4. The SCO should be congratulated for the addition of the\nWest African Farming Systems Network and potentially several\nother new Networks. \n5. There are no alternative viable regional institutions\nto the SAFGRAD/SCO for providing the regional political and\nadministrative services to these Networks.\n\nB. SAFGRAD Networks\n1. In SAFGRAD II the Networks have gotten off to a good\nstart. The Networks now have good Coordinators, Steering\nCommittees, and there is a SAFGRAD Oversight Committee.\n2. The IARCs are providing able leadership with IITA\nmoving faster than ICRISAT in putting well respected African\nscientists into Network leadership positions on a full-time basis\nand collaborating closely with the SCO.\n3. There is a consensus that the present IARC leadership\nof the Networks is temporary and that gradually responsibilities\nwill be assumed by NARS scientists.\n4. Lack of trained personnel has been identified as a\nmajor constraint for emergence of greater national leadership.\n5. There are presently informal meetings between the SCO\nand Network Coordinators and between the SCO and the IARCs.\n6. The present management process of the SCO and the\nNetworks does not allow for sufficient internal self-appraisal.\n\nC. International Agricultural Research Centers\n1. The Evaluation Team has confirmed the IARC commitment\nto the Networks, including the gradual shift of Network leader-\nship from IARCs to NARSs. \n2. The Evaluation Team has noticed an over-emphasis on\nbreeding in the regional trials of all the Networks. \n\"\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "\"A. SAFGRAD Coordination office\n\n1. A Strategy Document needs to be prepared as soon as\npossible and adapted to the current financial constraints and to\nthe new role of the SCO of principally providing services to\npresent and new Networks during the remainder of SAFGRAD II.\n\n2. In collaboration with the NARS and the Network Coordinators, the SCO should take leadership in preparing an inventory of the long-term training requirements of the\nscientists in the NARSs. This document should then be brought to\nthe attention of various donors.\n\n3. The SCO should re-establish the publication of a\nnewsletter and set up a desk top publishing unit in support of\nthe Networks. Some additional funding may need to be sought for\nthis.\n\n4. The SCO should request the Oversight Committee to\nnegotiate with the OAU/STRC for increased financial support, a\ndelegation of authority in certain managerial matters, and the\neventual institutionalization of the SCO within the OAU/STRC.\n\n5. The SCO should be congratulated for implementing\ncollaborative relationships with regional projects especially\nINSAH (Sahel) and SACCAR (Southern Africa). \n\n6. The SCO is encouraged to continue seeking funding for\nstaff expansion from the OAU/STRC for an administrative assistant\nand from the Ford Foundation or similar entity for a full-time\nscientific editor.\n\nB. International Agricultural Research Centers\n1. The Network Coordinator position is a demanding one and\nshould not be combined with the leadership of a regional research\nteam. \n\n2. Nevertheless, Network Coordinators should be allowed to\ncontinue some research (up to 20% of their time) to maintain\ntheir credibility with their fellow scientists in the NARSs and in the IARCs.\n\n3. In collaboration with the SCO, the Network Coordinators\nand the IARC staff should develop a comprehensive plan of human\ncapital development for the NARS scientists in the Networks.\n\n4. Some NARS representatives from the Networks should be\ninvited to participate in the annual internal reviews of the\nIARCs.\n\n5. A plan for more direct support of the Networks from\nthe central research stations (Ibadan for IITA and Niamey for\nICRISAT) by other research scientists should be developed and\nimplemented before the end of SAFGRAD II.\n\n6. More regular consultation between IARC managements and\nthe SCO is necessary to create a more collegial environment and\nto strengthen the Networks.\n\n7. Cultivar testing in the NARSs and in the Networks needs to be preceded by region-specific experiments designed to economically increase water availability and improve soil fertility.\n\nC. SAPGRAD Networks\n\n1. A plan for turning the Network coordination positions\nover to NARS scientists at the start of SAFGRAD III needs to be\ndeveloped in each Network by the Steering Committees. \n\n2. A program for monthly meetings between Network\nCoordinators, the International Coordinator and the Director of\nResearch needs to be established.\n\n3. The Steering Committees should continue to take an\nactive role in periodic research priority reviews in their respective Networks.\n\nD. USAID\n\n1. USAID should continue the support of the SCO at\napproximately the present level of funding for the duration of\nSAFGRAD II.\n\n2. A Director of Research position and support staff, both\nsupported by the IFAD until April 1989, needs to be retained in\nthe SCO to support the Networks for the duration of SAFGRAD II.\n\n3. USAID can stop looking for alternative organizations to\nmanage the Networks as long as the SCO retains adequate staff and\ncontinues to concentrate its activities on the Networks.\n\n4. USAID and other donors can further strengthen the crop\nNetworks through specific financing of their research projects in\nspecific countries.\n\"",

Participants involved in\nin-country training programs and graduates of regional workshops spoke highly of their experiences and of the contacts and linkages they had established with other scientists and technicians in the region as a result of these networking programs.\nSimilarly, the graduate training and manpower development programs were highly regarded, both those directly funded\nby SACCAR and those coordinated through its regional sub-projects. For the regional sub-projects felt that the Technical Advisory Panels (TAPs) served a useful function by providing for project monitoring and strategy guidance. SACCAR is promoting this body as well as commodity specific steering committees as vehicles and channels for regional and national coordination. Through this kind of networking, SACCAR has been able to identify effectively areas of priority in research and training which are of regional and national importance and interest.",

Also, most United States Agency for International Development (U.S.A.I.D.) mission officers interviewed by the evaluation team ranked F/FRED high among A.I.D.'s centrally-funded projects. It is encouraging that these missions' portfolios include projects, such as upland agriculture development, which will enhance LDC capacity to use MPTS research output.\n2. The Evaluation Team found the Contractor's performance to be generally adequate and, in some aspects, excellent. Progress to date indicates that the contract's requirements will be met.\n3.  The Evaluation Team's overall conclusion is that A.I.D. can correctly consider F/FRED to be one of its important, innovative projects. Adequate long-term financial support for this research-focused, 10-year project should be seen by A.I.D. as a desirable development investment.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. A.I.D. should provide the fund's needed to carry F/FRED through Fiscal Year (FY) 1990 (the end of Phase I) without loss of momentum and full funding to move it effectively through Phase II(FY 1991-1995).\n2. A.I.D. should try to provide additional funds in FY 1989 or FY 1990 to sustain the momentum of F/FRED.\n3. A.I.D. should include in Phase II documents specific language and, perhaps, an earmarked fund to maintain F/FRED's flexible response capacity.\n4.  The Contractor should arrange for one full-time coordinator for each of the two zonal MPTS research networks.\n5. The Contractor should bring economics into the main stream of F/FRED-supported research activity. To begin, the Contractor should prepare a work plan for the design and testing of methodology for economic contributions to MPTS analysis.\n6.  The Contractor should prepare an issues paper on data-sharing for consideration by the MPTS Research Committee and A.I.D.\n7.

      "Key Findings": "While the needs and progress of MPTS projects vary among the countries, there was general agreement on: the importance of farmers' needs, interests, preferences, and awareness levels to successful project implementation, the need to develop national-level networks in research and to disseminate information and research findings, and the need to involve more social scientists in MPTS research.\nIt was unanimously agreed by the Research Committee that national-level development should include F/FRED-sponsored site visits, Improved ties between the Research Committee and the Coordinating Unit, and more visits by \"foreign\" members of the Research Committee to national MPTS research meetings.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "To enhance knowledge of the interaction of MPTS with arable crops, it was agreed that separate trials be initiated at four or five\nlocations.\n\nThe importance of uniform research methods was stressed. For each trial, a program to familiarize investigators with the agreed methods is necessary. In reviewing the species to be included in a\nnetwork trial, species of regional importance should be given top priority. Design of future network trials should consider farmers' existing practices, inter-cropping trees and crops, planting patterns, as well as the feasibility of proposed interventions incorporating both biological and social requirements.\n\nIn reviewing the progress of regional studies and the program of small research grants, the Committee felt that:\n1) the present research methodology and\nfindings on farm and village land-and forest use practices will help shape studies at regional and national levels in Phase 2 of F/FRED\n2) both regional and national research should receive fair and balanced attention.\n3) it Is important to the compilation of the research compendia to share secondary materials\nWith regard to the remainder of Phase 1, the Committee agreed that:\n1) cost analyses of the Plantek trials and other network trials should take place\n2) a market study is needed to contribute to the development of a suitable research methodology",

      "Key Findings": "Some progress has been made towards achievement of the project purpose, as the small number of potato scientists is being used more efficiently. Research progress is evident in such areas\nas: development and dissemination of improved varieties resistant\nto major diseases (Late Blight and Bacterial Wilt); rapid seed multiplication techniques; production of clean seed; diffused light stores for seed both on-station and on-farm; ware potato storage, integrated pest management; use of repellant plants in stores; and dormancy breaking. It is difficult, however, to separate the impact of PRAPAC from the impact of CIP and/or other support for national potato research  programs.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Recommendations addressed to PRAPAC are designed to use research resources more efficiently and to strengthen research collaboration, monitoring, and reporting.\nTechnical re-orientation is also suggested on some fronts, e.g. the re-initiation of true potato seed research, the screening of R-gene free germplasm for blight resistance, a study of the long-term viability of fungicide use for the control of L .e Blight, use\nof an integrated pest and disease control framework, and evaluation of the viability of mid-elevation potato production. A number of recommendations are also designed to help\nPRAPAC use the Coordinator more effectively. \nOther recommendations are designed to help establish PRAPAC as an entity distinct from CIP it is also recommended that the\ncollection and monitoring of socio-economic baseline data receive much more emphasis in the network. Another recommendation highlights the need for PRAPAC to improve linkages between potato research and the agencies responsible for seed bulking and distribution, and extension.",

Work has commenced on developing improved\ncropping systems; however, since this activity builds on successful germplasm  introduction more effort in this area is anticipated for the remaining LOP. Bean research capability in national programs has been significantly improved and expanded as a result of project training and project assistance to national programs. CEABRN is well managed with a good administrative management system. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "It is recommended that breeding programs at the NARS define their objectives more clearly. This can be achieved through more direct. contact with the new CIAT breeder, and advanced degree training as well as CIAT short-term training. This will result in a crossing program to incorporate traits from the new germplasm into locally and regionally adapted lines.\nPriorities in the breeding program should be set as soon as possible and primary consideration be given to constraints that can be solved in a short time, i.e. plant habit. disease/pest resistance, maturity. cooking characteristics and seed types. Bean nitrogen fixation (BNF) protein quality and export marketability are examples of lower priority issue,.\nScreening should conducted on an trials be individual pathogen/pest basis as much as possible. Areas that offer a high incidence of disease/pest severity should be sought and maintained. The of use of spreaders and artificial inoculation may be necessary.\nEfforts should be made by both CEABRN and national program\nresearchers to develop a better understanding of farmer\npractices before making research recommendations",

This project approach has been characterized by its emphasis on short-term \"solutions\" and by the establishment of structures which are parallel to, rather than reinforce, national and local governmental institutions. There is also considerable fragmentation and duplication of efforts. Consequently, the contribution of the project approach to the improvement of agricultural research should be seriously questioned in the absence of a strong national coordinating capability.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Preparation of a clearly defined, problem-oriented national program for production systems research composed of both on- and off-station components. Establishment of a national network at multi-location trial sites selected systematically to cover the country's three major agricultural environments, and managed by the ISAR  Research Committee to assure coordinated use by all ISAR Departments. ISAR should start defining its own research priorities and establish national, sub-regional, and international scientific collaboration programs.",

Thirteen sub- projects are operational, research networks have been established,  socio-economic research is complementing technical research, and a donor group under World Bank leadership is cooperating enthusiastically. The umbrella features of the SAARFA project are definitely appropriate, because of Africa's huge size, diverse ecology and critical need for improved technology.\n\nContinuing improvement in management of SAARFA's direct or core activities will be needed. Existing problems are mainly\nadministrative details having to do with cooperative agreements (buy- ins). The delegation of the management functions to the field has gone smoothly. Slow vouchering and reporting, when they occur, are due more to external conditions that are beyond control than to lax internal project management.\n\nNetworking was found to be working effectively and is a definite\nadvancement in facilitating research; notwithstanding, interactions\nbetween bilateral programs and the networks and between socio-economic \"buy-in\" research and IARC commodity research should be strengthened.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Cooperation among and between donors in providing support to NARS through the SAARFA project. More effort should be made to explain SPAAR's purpose and benefit to African officials.\nAt all levels of donor interaction on agricultural research, the U.S. should fully assert its interests, comparative strengths and capacities for leadership\nAt SPAAR and similar donor meetings, U.S. delegates should be authorized to represent the U.S. on technical and budgetary matters with the full support of the Agency.\nA logical framework matrix should be prepared for SAARFA and all future sub-projects should have logical frameworks which mirrow SAARFA's purposes and procedures. This will provide a better basis for monitoring and evaluating this umbrella project and it sub-projects.\nMaintain current decentralized arrangements for providing administrative management support to sub-projects in Africa For SAARFA II, officials should determine the feasibility and desirability of making arrangements in West and Sahelian Africa which parallel currently highly satisfactory arrangements in East and Southern Africa.\nMaintain current decentralized arrangements for providing administrative management support to sub-projects in Africa For SAARFA II, officials should determine the feasibility and desirability of making arrangements in West and Sahelian Africa which parallel currently highly satisfactory arrangements in East and Southern Africa.",

In the context of ICRAF's evolution from a research support service to a full partner, working closely with National\nAgriculture Research organizations, ICRAF should be commended. Although there were several delays in becoming operational in some countries, the administrative, training and technical support service from ICRAF has generally been good.\n\nWhile much progress has been made, the evaluation's timing marks the end of AFRENA's initial institutional development activities and heralds the beginning of a new phase of research planning and implementation. Although much of the ICRAF and host country institutional policy and structure is in place, several activities need to be modified or reoriented towards a more pragmatic approach, according to the Evaluation Team.",
      "Key Recommendations": "To achieve the project goal AFRENA will need to bring a wider variety of beneficiaries into research development, although some revision of the project purpose is recommended. A greater emphasis on demand-driven technologies, based on a solid\nunderstanding of farm-level, socio-economic constraints, will be required. In addition, AFRENA will need to develop a second series of practical, skill-building exercises in support of a more iterative diagnostic and design (D&D) analysis methodology.\n\nAn increased emphasis in the production of quality nursery stock for on-station and adaptive research trials is warranted. AFRENA should also increase the attention it provides toward alternative plant production techniques. Finally, in order to achieve the project objectives, USAID's Project Manager will need to ensure that additional resources, not presently forthcoming from bilateral missions, are made available to ICRAF. USAID should also reconsider the role of REDSO/ESA in overall management responsibility.",

Seven of the sub-projects studied were built on foundations laid by previous projects or private sector activities. In other instances, the private sector would probably have responded to market opportunities without the ATT sub-project. However, it is the opinion of the evaluation team, based on statements by private endusers, that the sub-projects accelerated the use and increased the economic impact of new technologies.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Several possible means of amelioration are proposed for the administrative problems described above. First of all, the decision to transform all additional funds into grant would eliminate one source of additional paperwork and delay.\n\nSecond, it is suggested that other Departments follow the example of the Department of Fisheries in assigning administrative tasks of sub-projects to their respective Finance and Planning Divisions. \n\nThird, the role of the project secretariat should be re-defined as\nfacilitating, rather than controlling, the implementation of sub-projects.

This survey showed that 84 percent of the short-term and 73 percent of the long-term alumni were currently employed. Employment rates varied by fields of study and by country, and do not reveal the exact nature or extent of each participant's current job. Still, unemployment rates for secondary school graduates (CASP's target population) remain high. CASP can take pride in increasing employment opportunities for those participating in the program.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Existing CASP management systems need to e strengthened, particularly with respect top retention, recruitment and selection procedures.  Existing CASP promotion, recruitment, and selection procedures constrain overall program quality and efficiency. Promotional and recruitment mechanisms tend to encourage a disproportionately large number of unqualified or overly qualified candidates. Selection procedures mitigate against each candidate being properly interviewed. Technical Training Programs Offered by CASP Need to Better Address the Job Needs of Participants: Despite the high employment rate for returned participants which CASP has achieved, there is much concern about the nature of the skills that have been acquired.\nConsideration should he given to the provision of more in-country ESL Training, so that participants can better utilize their time in the U.S. to improve technical knowledge and skill: A major constraint on CASP's ability to provide better technical training is that participants greatly vary in English language proficiency when they arrive in the U.S.\nA.I.D. and Georgetown University should strive to increase collaborative efforts in support of CASP: The \"earmarking\" of CASP, and its special status as a cooperative agreement, have tended to mitigate against effective collaboration between Georgetown and A.I.D.",

      "Key Findings": "Several projects are facing significant difficulties in attaining\ncommercialization. Constraints include:\nSlow progress due to communications problems and difficulties in obtaining necessary research equipment and supplies;\nUnwillingness of a partner to transfer key intellectual property;\nSale of one partner to anew company or change of management of a partner;\nInability to attain originally planned technical specifications;\nInability to attain expected production costs;\nDifficulties in obtaining contracts or approval from buyers;\nInadequate arrangements for protection and transfer of intellectual property.\n\nAt this early stage int he project no grantee has sold a good or technology developed under a PACT grant, although several can now begin to market a product.  In all cases reviewed, costs of production and wholesale prices for products developed under sub-projects have not been established. Whether the products\ncan be sold for prices that will cover costs and provide profits to sponsors remains to be seen. Therefore it is too early to determine the profitability of any of the sub-projects.\n\nFinally, no companies reported that they will carry out additional R&D because of their experience under PACT. Most Indian company stated that they would wait until they had begun commercial production of products developed under PACT before they would conclude plans for additional collaborative R&D. It is clear that the most important factor causing Increases in R&D capacity in Indian firms will be demonstration of the profitability of commercially-oriented R&D.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Improve Legal Agreements Between Partners for Profits and Intellectual Property. ICICI should encourage partners to conclude adequate legal arrangements for distribution of benefits derived from commercialization at the outset of a sub-project.\nImprove ICICI Legal Agreements. Several terms in ICICI sub-project agreements need to be clarified. These include definition of 'innovation' produced by a sub-project, specification of the revenues that will be subject to PACT royalty fees, and clarification of royalty fees that will be charged in the event of transfer of intellectual property by license agreement.\nThe Need for Additional PACT Funds. If additional funds are available, USAID should provide the minimum amount needed to allow new project approvals from late FY 1990 until early FY 1992. If$1.6 million more is provided, then the PACT fund can approve of four new projects during that year, with an average grant\nper project of $400,000.\nImprove Communication. Steps should be taken to improve communication between ICICI and PACT partners. ICICI should also consider assisting grantees in improving communication between the partners.\nClarify Battelle's role in the PACT Project. There is a need to establish the limitations of Battelle's role in technical oversight of projects, and to establish a formal protocol for technical progress reviews.",

The funded studies, which have been refined through the ADDR \"mentor-researcher\" relationship, are well designed and respond to important issues within the priority themes.\n\nA review of the proposals approved for funding suggests that\nlocal researchers within the ADDR network have benefited from the assistance provided through the project. With some exceptions, the first round of proposals required three modifications before approval was given. Although only a few investigators have submitted a second research proposal, e.g., Bhutta from Pakistan, indications are that the quality of the most recent proposals is clearly superior to those submitted in the first round.\nThere is, however, a considerable gap between enhancing the\nresearch capacity of local investigators and achieving\ninstitutional self-reliance in research. Project resources have\nclearly been used to achieve the former; resources have not been\nfocused to attain the latter. If investments in developing the\nresearch capacity of local investigators are to be sustained\nthrough local institutions, efforts must be made to identify the\nresources needed to complement ADDR support.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "Research in the emphasis areas should continue,\nalthough increasing attention should be given to linking research\nquestions with national programs and policy formulation, and\nefforts should be undertaken to document and disseminate the\ncontent and results of the research both in-country and throughout the ADDR network. A.I.D. should consider requesting PRITECH and HEALTHCOM assistance in facilitating the dissemination of study content and results undertaken by ADDR.\nThe team recommends that this model to\ndevelop research capacity be documented. Implementation of this\nmodel should continue, allowing for its evolution, refinement, and\nfurther development that can ensure the self-reliance of the\ninvestigators. Over the next two years the project should focus\non consolidating the gains made in the seven emphasis countries.\nThe Cooperative Agreement should be extended\nto maintain the current management of the project. (See F below)\nSince this project has the potential to develop significant\ncapacity for research in developing countries, A.I.D. should\nconsider designing a new five-year project at the conclusion of and following an evaluation of the extended existing CA.\nADDR should continue to develop local researchers and good\nquality research projects in.the seven emphasis countries.",

      "Key Findings": "Our findings are that while some literature exists, little research has been done on the subject of forestry research networks to capture the existing knowledge, experience, and ideas of scientists who comprise research networks; to test the rationale and assumptions about them; end, to systematically understand the nature of existing forestry research networks.\nA major finding is that the definition of a forestry research network remains unclear. This has important implications for understanding networks in their various forms and for identifying the factors which may ensure their success and sustainability as appropriate. We provide a definition of a forestry research network that will likely be controversial, but we submit that it is essential to move the debate one step further.\nAs anticipated, we found various models for forestry research networks exist, but some pose problems that should be better understood. Among these are some of the models provided by the experience of the agricultural research community. And, again as expected we found that forestry research networks are not necessarily an appropriate form of organization for every re searchable  problem in forestry.\nWe found that forestry research networks are predictably plagued by a number of constraints. Foremost among these is funding.",
      "Key Recommendations": "We recommend that until more is known, blueprint approaches should not be applied to the design of any forestry research networking efforts. Different problems, approaches, interests, conditions, and priorities require different research strategies to produce knowledge to resolve those problems. (If A.I.D. is interested in funding only one model of research network, it should be careful that the model is appropriate to the situation.\nWe recommend that forestry research networks provide more support for increased interactions among scientists. The respondents to the questionnaire seemed to be implying that mere access to information was not enough, interaction is required.\nWe recommend that factors such as the role of participants in network management and implementation be given more attention as soon as possible in order to move towards increased sustainability. (This seems to be a critical area since many of the individual factors for success are highly linked among themselves as are many of the factors for sustainability.)",

      "Key Recommendations": "Although networks are promoted because they can effectively :rod inexpensively bring together an interdisciplinary critical mass of research effort, they may pay a price in terms of research efficiency arising from less accountability of scientists to the network than to their own administration and because network scientists are more scattered. In many individuals fill vacancies or move to higher, unrelated positions.\n\nThere needs to be an evaluation of the cost-benefit ratios of using well-funded multidisciplinary institutes compared with networks for providing answers to problems. I believe the effectiveness depends on the importance of the problem to be solved and the clarity of the research objective. In addition, networks are probably more effective in tackling problems that are straightforward and limited and where the objective is time-bound. They are also probably more cost effective in disseminating research results over a wide area than if done at isolated institutes.\n\nThe return on investment in networks needs to be compared with that for similar investments in IARCs or in NARSs although I believe that the three complement each other and that all should be supported. In the long term, each NARS must be able to provide the agricultural research needed for its country. ",

Discounting cultural factors, the same opportunities were available to women as for men. The evaluation found promotional activities to be adequate. Women had the same opportunities to apply to the program as men. Those entities targeted for recruitment, such as government ministries and agencies, private sector, and graduates of Mission scholarship programs, were appropriate.\nSerious problems arose during placement procedures, mostly with the 1990 placements. The Mission and LASPAU clarified the situation, and on August 9, 1990 LASPAU issued a written policy statement which repeated what was included in the Grant agreement.\nThe Mission utilized the grant mechanism and a non-competitive procurement in awarding this project to LASPAU. LASPAU conducted the project within its normal operating guidelines with minimal Mission involvement. LASPAU and its subcontractor SDSU provided the Mission with large amounts of raw data related to various aspects of the project.",
      "Key Recommendations": "The evaluation recommends that the Mission complete the training program as envisioned in the Project with the adjustment of sending a limited number of candidates to Latin American Universities for their M.A.'s first, and then on to the U.S. for placement in economics programs in top university graduate schools.\nThe evaluation recommends the following modifications in the selection process: 1) the selection committee should conduct a part of the selection interview in English to help determine applicant English language proficiency; 2) LASPAU should raise the minimum range of acceptable test scores for the PAEG; 3) the Mission should implement a second phase of the selection in which the Mission and LASPAU will interview the finalists and the Mission will provide final approval; 4) LASPAU should contract with an eminent economist not affiliated with any LASPAU sponsoring institution to serve on the selection committee.\nCurrent promotional activities will have to be expanded and candidates recruited from other sources if more economists are to be recruited.\nBoth the practice of mixing LASPAU/ Honduras scholars with programs from other countries as well as the form and content of the progress reports SDSU provides to the Mission and LASPAU for project management need to be addressed in subsequent upgrading programs.\nThe evaluation recommends that LASPAU proceed with future placements in accordance with its written policy statement and the Grant agreement. The evaluation further recommends that LASPAU should consider revising its selection procedure time schedule to an earlier period so that applications are submitted earlier to a wider variety of the top 30 economics programs.",

      "Key Findings": "Relevance and Relation to National Programs: The initial research planning and priority setting process in each network, with the exception of West Africa Sorghum, assured the responsiveness of network research to national program priorities. National program researchers listed and ranked the major production constraints in their country or by agro-ecological region and used this list to agree upon a ranked order of priority network research themes. \nIn some cases the identified, important national research problems did not make it onto the initial network research agenda. Researchers in the West Africa Maize and Sorghum East  \nNetworks, for example, ranked soil, water and pest management, intercropping and farming systems issues as research priorities. According to the network coordinators and steering committee members, these themes were too site-specific to use for defining and implementing an effective regional research program. \n\nThe initial priority setting exercises reflected the biases found in most national programs toward the biological definition of production constraints. The predominance of plant breeders on most steering Committees during the early years reproduced national program orientations and thereby tended to orient network research to biological problems at the expense of broader agronomic, or even social or economic problems. Network planning did not consider the socio-economic or policy \ndimensions of the production constraints on crop production. \nNetwork program priorities reflect widely acknowledged problems \nof semi-arid agriculture, but lack a sense of being grounded in farm-level realities. It is not clear to what extent they respond to farm-level priorities as expressed by small farmers.",
      "Key Recommendations": "The strategy hinges on the expectation of continued external funding for the IARC network coordinator positions for the next 2 to 3 years. Additional thought is also needed in order to specify how the national programs will set the agendas for regional network research in collaboration with the IARCs, and to identify how the networks might be able to tap the scientific resources of more than one IARC.\nA Harmonization Committee of SAFGRAD and CORAF researchers and administrators met in May 1990. This committee agreed: (1)IITA should backstop both networks; (2)each network  had separate, but also some common areas of research interest  (3)network coordinators should coordinate the respective calendar of network events; and, (4)scientific  information should be exchanged between networks.\n\nThe Committee recommended: (1) the establishment of one maize network with one steering committee within two years; (2) a meeting of the CORAF and SAFGRAD executive bodies to explore ways for merging the networks; and, (3) several interim actions to improve inter-network dialogue and exchange. Consistent with the guidance from the SAFGRAD Oversight Committee and the Council of NARD, and the recommendations of the 1990 SAFGRAD-CORAF Maize Network Harmonization Committee meeting, the SAFGRAD International Coordinator has urged CORAF to collaborate in the harmonization of both maize networks.",

      "Key Findings": "HRDP has been successful in selecting suitable PhD fellows and placing them in topnotch universities and departments. Some non-degree training has also taken place. Bangladesh now has a significant number of scholars in certain social science fields, which can contribute to greater in-country training in some social science fields, yet the country will require for the foreseeable future, more opportunities for overseas fellowships in a range of social science fields.\n\nConsiderable efforts have been devoted to the\nestablishment of an RSSN, linking rural social scientists from universities, National Agricultural Research System (NARS), other government organizations (GOs), and non-governmental organizations (NGOs).The network has a mixed record of success.  It has helped to bring WI fellows together in collaborative efforts but its impact on policy has been limited and unfocused. Its rapid growth without careful planning has reduced its effectiveness.\n\nNo research grants or awards have been awarded since\n1987, because of lack of a clear research agenda outlining priority, doable research topics; a cumbersome, time-consuming process and a lack of guidelines for reviewing research proposals and clear guidelines for selection.\n\nSince 1988 the computer network has undertaken a number of activities including the procurement and allocation of computer\nfacilities (hardware and software), although it has not always followed the automation plan and providing training support to individual researchers and institutions.",
      "Key Recommendations": "WI and USAID need to address the issue of support for the current fellows whose studies will not be completed prior to the end of the program in 1993; consideration should be given to extending the program under TRP-II beyond 1993 for this purpose. The high return at relatively low cost of local PhD research awards also warrants greater support in the program.\nAn RSSN planning session or sessions need to be held to decide on the network bylaws, goals, charters and research agenda linking them to the policy agenda with input from BARC and other concerned GO policy makers.\nUnder BARC's auspices an RSSN workshop is to be arranged to identify priority research areas for agriculture policy and to develop the strategies, guidelines, and procedures for reviewing, selecting, and supporting research grant proposals without further delay.\nThe HRDP computer network coordinator should carry out a needs assessment of the RSSN for computer hardware, software, and training and regain physical possession of computer hardware distributed for purposes that do not contribute to program objectives. In close consultation with BARC, the program leader, RSSN members, and the computer network coordinator ought to establish a new computer network committee and decide on guidelines and procedures for the leasing of computer hardware",

When interviewed at end of training prior to their return to Costa Rica, Trainees were virtually unanimous in their views that the pre-departure English language training (93%) orientation to U.S. life and culture (92%) and program information (91%) ranged from somewhat useful to extremely useful. Approximately two-thirds of the Costa Rican respondents felt that they were either very prepared (24%) or prepared (65%) for their trip to and training in the United States.\nWith respect to Experience America activities, Costa Rican Trainees at the end of training prior to returning home, indicated that they participated in a wide variety of activities while in the United States: cultural events (100%), athletic events (98%), visited with U.S. families (94%), traveled around the U.S. (89%), and attended civic activities (78%).\nWhether interviewed at time of departure from the U.S. to their home or after their return to Costa Rica, Trainees agreed that most of their personal expectations were met. Both interviews revealed that Trainees valued their opportunities to interact socially with U.S.\nWhen asked to rate the United States along special characteristics, Trainees on departure from the U.S. saw the United States as strong (91%), generous (91%), wealthy (88%), natural (88%), friendly (80%), sensitive (76%), orderly (68%), and militarily peaceful (65%). \nMost Trainees agreed that their personal skill training expectations were met. The majority (83%) ji Costa Rican Trainees, when interviewed at end of training prior to their return home, indicated that their original objectives were realized to a \"very great extent\" (360%), or a \"great extent\" (51%). ",
      "Key Recommendations": "The Mission should continue to stress low costs with their contractors (i.e., continue to do what they're doing). In addition, as S&T/IT's contractors begin to use TCA formats for reporting of actual expenditures by PIO/P, the Mission should require quarterly expenditure accounts on every academic Trainee to ensure that the low budgets for academic training evolve into actual low expenditures.\nSteps should be taken to select more minorities from Limon. Some attempt should be made to account for the number and destination of application forms whether by the Mission or intermediary agencies to ensure as wide a distribution as practicable. Consider developing a simple processing procedure to facilitate and expedite the application review process.\nThe Mission should continue its current efforts to develop and\nimplement a follow-up program. However, AID/Washington needs to develop strategies that facilitate funding of follow-up activities both through CAPS as well as through other funding sources.\nThe Mission should continue its efforts to describe training requests in terms of specific skill objectives for both the experience America component and the skill training component. To this end, the Mission should require all contractors to submit detailed training plans prior to Mission signing of the training contract. ",

This would be explored by inviting representatives from these\ncountries to observe the next Research Committee meeting, in conjunction with support from other donors.\nThe Committee re-affirmed the Network's commitment to strengthening national institutions through a coordinated program, according to priorities set forth by each national committee.\nIn discussing the Network's mandate, the\nCommittee re-affirmed the Network's relative\npriority on the production role of trees for market\nand household uses. In emphasizing the capacity of trees to provide commodities to farmers, the Network seeks to complement the work of ICPAF and other organizations already studying nutrient cycling, soil erosion, and the dynamics of agroforestry systems.\nThe Committee authorized a study of possible contribution of the experience of the MPTS Research Network toward the development of an international initiative to support Natural Forest Management. Proposals to adjust the Network's mandate in this direction, however, will require much advance consultation and consideration of the effects at all levels of Network activities.",
      "Key Recommendations": "That, in decisions regarding the Network's mandate, the Steering Committee:\nAdopt a \"multiple user perspective\" to address the socioeconomic issues of all forestry-related land use systems that have significant potential in rural development, and/or a significant interaction with local communities, including farm forestry, social forestry, agroforestry (sensu lato) and natural forest management near human communities (including protection and production forests).\nReinforce, in farm-based research, the Network's primary focus on the tree component of land-use systems, including multipurpose food trees under extensive management, as well as the tree component of agroforestry systems.\nExpand the component focus in forest-based research to incorporate a significant secondary focus on non-timber forest products.\nTranscend the traditional preoccupation with production systems to develop a \"product focus\" that gives due attention to marketing, processing, and utilization of tree and forest products, and that seeks to achieve conservation goals as a by-product of enlightened production interests.",

CIP has collaborated with ESARRN to expand the survey work to include sweet potatoes.\nESARRN has played an important role in the characterization of post-harvest handling, rural processing, and utilization of cassava in the region, mainly through the COSCA studies.\nThe review team felt that the management and implementation by IITA has been effective in contributing to the achievement of project outputs, purpose and goal. I1TA's scientists and senior management officials have made several visits to the network countries to update themselves of progress \nThere appears to be no question that the network has helped to increase the capacity of the NARS to generate root crops technology. There is evidence that root crops are playing an increasingly important role in national research prioritization which is reflected in both government planning documents as well as budget allocations.",
      "Key Recommendations": "That the NARS take the lead in discussing the role that the international research institutes should play in support of ESARRN in the future.\nThat the network steering committee increase its membership to 7 MARS representatives and limit its meetings to once a year.\nImprove administrative support.\nThat collaborating countries increase the volume and exchange of locally adapted and selected disease-free materials with one another, thus shortening the overall time to multiplication and release.\nThat research on processing and utilization of root crops be further intensified to develop and test simple improved techniques appropriate to rural and urban households, thus increasing the range of products available to consumers.\nThat low cyanide varieties and the use of enzymatic assays for testing be emphasized in the breeding programs, and, where farmers express a preference for a high cyanide variety, appropriate processing techniques be popularized.\nThat the numbers of on-farm trials and demonstrations be greatly increased and more use made of audio visual materials and multi-media techniques to carry extension messages, thus substantially increasing the flow of new technologies and information to farmers.\nExisting root crops research programs in the network should be reviewed to determine what the remaining training needs are to ensure the presence of an effective core of NARS staff.",

      "Document Title": "Schistosomiasis Research Project (263-0140.2): Midterm Evaluation",
      "Key Findings": "A total of eight laboratories in Cairo and in Assiut have now been equipped with state-of-the-art equipment. Initial mistakes in commodity procurement, due to MSCI staffing problems, were rectified and continuing complaints appeared to the team to be few.\nGrants have been awarded to eighteen Young Scientists. Two of these, from Cycle One, have completed their projects, written them up, and successfully applied for major grants as Principal Investigators in Cycle Five. Three more have been selected in Cycle Six.\nThe Schistosome Biological Materials Supply unit in TBRI is complete and is producing a more-than-adequate supply of materials for all Pis who request them. The SBMS unit seems to be outstanding in terms of maintenance and performance.\nOther support units, not identified in the Project Paper, have been approved by the Steering Committee and will be established in the near future within the precincts of VACSERA. These will include a Small Animal Facility, an Information Retrieval Center, a \nLiquid Nitrogen Supply Center, and a Micro-instrumentation Facility for DNA Synthesis.\nA list of thirteen GOE collaborating institutions and three private institutions, as well as eleven collaborating American institutions, is given in Annex G. All of these institutions now perceive the SRP as a unifying entity whose collaborators are working toward the same goals.",
      "Key Recommendations": "A continuing, although possibly reduced, relationship between the University of Lowell and the SBMS is strongly recommended.\nFunding mechanisms should be identified now to assure\nthe continuity of these supply installations after the PACD, with particular emphasis to be placed on the one for information retrieval.\nThe Team feels that the constructive nature of the\nassociations that have been achieved in the course of the work will eventually be considered as one of the positive contributions of the project and that this should eventually be identified as such in the final report.\nThe Evaluation Team does not believe that an amendment\nto the project is needed at this time, since the primary purpose of the project remains basically to \"develop, through directed research, the tools, methods, and information necessary to assist the GOE in more effectively controlling Schistosomiasis.\"\nThe implementation schedule for all components of the\nSRP merits regular revision at the meetings of the Steering Committee to bring it into line with actual activities.",

      "Key Findings": "The PASA has successfully met its original objectives of fostering international  collaborative research relationships needed to carry out HIV/AIDS research and providing training and technical assistance to developing country scientists. \nThe PASA, as it is now structured and perceived, is not a valued contributor to the  USAID HIV/AIDS program. This reflects the evolution of USAID program goals and current program start-up priorities, outdated PASA objectives, and administrative problems. \nThe PASA has the potential to effectively support the identification and pursuit of common research interests of the NIH and USAID HIV/AIDS programs. This can be achieved by clarifying PASA goals and objectives, involving appropriate NIH program staff and USAID contractors in order to identify mutual research interests, and addressing the administrative weaknesses experienced to date. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "Funding criteria should be established that continue to allow flexibility in the kinds of activities that are funded but that limit funding to activities that directly contribute to the development of NIH research proposals within the defined areas of common interest, or that link NIH research to specific training or assistance need of USAID HIV/AIDS prevention efforts. USAID will need to consider the human resource  implications of supporting development of research in priority countries on a case-by-case basis. Additionally, the $10,000 funding ceiling should be reconsidered to allow support for pretesting of innovative hypotheses. \nThe International AIDS Technical Assistance program should be better integrated with the USAID HIV/AIDS prevention program. Semi-annual meetings between appropriate NIH and USAID/AIDS and contractor staff should be convened to identify opportunities for research coordination, possibilities for collaboration, and areas of common research interests.

      "Document Title": "Final Report: Process Evaluation of the Historically Black Colleges and Universities Research Grants Program",
      "Key Findings": "The HBCU Research Grants Program is not designed as a cohesive research program. Grants are awarded for discrete projects, and no systematic method exists to assure that new grants will build on prior grant research results or will be related to other ongoing grants. Such cohesion as exists appears to have been the result\nmainly of the efforts of some of the HBCUs and principal investigators. Because of the fragmented and discrete nature of the research grants, integration of the research depends to a large extent on the commitment and continuity of research efforts at individual HBCUs.\nSecondly, the concept underlying the HBCU Research Grants Program contains an inherent conflict. The A.I.D. effort (and the efforts of other federal agencies) concerning HBCUs is \"to increase participation of minority institutions in problems\nof developing countries.\"  It was hoped that \"HBCU principal investigators would gain valuable experience ... that.., would enhance the competitiveness of HBCUs in securing grants and contracts for technical assistance projects from A.I.D. and other funding organizations.\" However, the research grants often are the result of the efforts of one researcher (or a very small group of researchers). These researchers often obtain multiple research grants, and often at different HBCUs.\nA.I.D. should consider carefully the aims of the Research Grants Program as they are related to development of institutions. To some extent, the program, despite its considerable successes, has not systematically addressed the direct development of HBCUs as much as it has encouraged individual researchers.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Drastic changes in the Research Grants Program are not recommended. However, it is suggested that A.I.D.:\nContinue program funding at the highest possible level.\nEnsure that the program is continually monitored, including feedback from the HBCUs.\nRevise the proposal due dates and accept proposals only once per year. The due date probably should be February 1.\nConsider allocating a portion of program funds for the development of \"centers of excellence\" for research in the agricultural and health sectors. (See further discussion below.)\nStrengthen contacts with HBCUs and linkage partners through symposia and workshops to make effective use of human and institutional resources.",

      "Key Findings": "As shown in the case of Ghana, however, developing countries can move a long way toward resolving international trade crises by careful examination and adjustment of domestic economic policies.\n\nIn Malawi, it is concluded that the basic terms of the tenant farming contract are beneficial to both tenants and landowners, but that the benefits are skewed in favor of the landowners\n\nIn Nigeria, least-squares analysis of smallholder farmer's allocation of crop output between home consumption and market sales reveals that household income and product prices are key policy variables that could be used to elicit an increased marketed surplus of staple food crops. In addition, there is strong evidence of the benefits that farm planning and credit availability could provide in raising the incomes and production of small-scale farmers.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Government policies should ensure that tractors are available to farmers. The government tractor service has been unreliable; farmers rely instead on private tractor services. The institutional framework must be developed to expand the availability of tractors and spare parts. Tractor use will become more\nprofitable if it is expanded to minimize labor bottlenecks during harvesting and threshing.\nA new strategy must focus not only on the development of the physical banking environment, but also on the institutional infrastructures which will reduce the socioeconomic distance between the rural poor and the banks. The rural people must be a part of the rural bank: ownership and management. The\nbank staff must adopt a more flexible approach in their operations to make their services more competitive and attractive. Finally, policies should be designed to increase and redistribute income to the rural poor.\nAmong other research concerns, efforts are needed to develop fast-maturing and high yielding rice varieties that are drought and disease resistant, acceptable to consumers, and affordable by\nsmallholder farmers.\nIf the fishing industries are to be viable, the government will have to institute policies that reduce the impact of the high cost of inputs. Inputs for fishing must be available at reasonable prices if fish production is to increase.\nBecause of the role of off-farm employment in stabilizing and enhancing the rural economy, any future policies aimed at food security and rural development must consider rural non farm. enterprises.",

The agreement was also reached on the monitoring criteria for the networks, the time framework and the level of funding, and management structure.",
      "Key Recommendations": "The network should be developed around subjects that the national research systems perceive to be important— for example, increasing production. Projected impact and achievements\nover a specified time span provide a basis for accountability.\nA clear and well-defined theme or strategy that relates the different activities/components to achieve the objectives is necessary to harmonize research. Research activities should normally be within the support capabilities of the members resources.\nThere must be some source or sources of improved technology to drive progress. Collaborative research networks are envisioned to be more than periodic meetings of scientists.\nA coordinating organization is needed to facilitate inter-country activities, provide technical backstopping, and arrange monitoring tours.\nA committee composed of participating scientists from the national agricultural systems should be in place to provide technical leadership and policy direction to the network.",

      "Key Findings": "While the relative level of research investment between rice and other crops appears not to have changed during DARP, the absolute amount of interest and investment in SFCs and other crops certainly has increased. Existing data indicate that little significant change has occurred in the relative levels of production, area planted and yields of the SFCs. The majority of gains will be realized as DARP investments payoff in increased focus on development and transfer of appropriate new technologies.\nDOA's interest in management has expanded over the years of DARP. DARP has facilitated DOA's pursuit of management improvement, which has resulted in ,such things as formulation of a DOA mission statement, a multi-year agricultural research plan, and a proposal L restructuring.\n\nDARP investments have strengthened the DOA's capacity to develop and transfer useful agriculture technology to farmers, mainly through increased highly-trained human resources, the purchase and construction of necessary technical equipment and facilities, and the provision of useful reports and advice from long-term and short-term consultants.\n\nFinally ,DOA lacks a mechanism for effective monitoring of activity impact. Virtually all the data which was provided for this evaluation was anecdotal or retrieved on an ad hoc  basis\nfrom surveys or reports. There has been little analysis or inquiry into the significance of the outputs produced with DARP inputs",
      "Key Recommendations": "An alternative worthy of' consideration is a private research foundation with mixed private and public participation. Such foundations have been established in LAC using a mix of PL480, dollar funding, and debt swaps. We recommend that USAID/Sri Lanka explore the possibility for such a foundation.\nWe believe that a special effort by the Mission to remain engaged will be well-repaid by continued collaboration, and will be welcomed by DOA. At a minimum, AID should provide support for periodic (yearly) reviews to continue to monitor the impacts and lessons learned from DARP.\nHe recommend that DOA increase its efforts an market research, particularly on priority crops.\nWe recommend that incentives (monetary and non-monetary) be structured in such a way as to encourage focus and interest on achieving client-level economic impact.\nWe recommend that the management training already in process be extended and deepened to include all management staff in order to build consensus around the logical relationships among inputs (resources), outputs : (the manageable results of use of inputs) and objectives (the impact sought, for which the\nresources are allocated).\nWe recommend that DOA seek to establish an annual allotment of funds from GSL, restricted to use for special projects, with a\nprohibition on its use for continuing (recurrent) costs.",

      "Key Findings": "One of the principal achievements of the project was the establishment of the semiautonomous National Center for Agricultural Research and Technology Transfer WCARlT) with its six regional agricultural services centers. NCARlT and these services centers are the principal subjects of the final evaluation.\n\nWhile anecdotal evidence shows that some farmers have adopted practices based on NCARTT (National Center for Agricultural Research and Technology Transfer) research, the transfer of technology to the average farmer has been weak.\nThe project design contained many good ideas but could have been improved by giving increased emphasis on: achieving fully autonomous status for NCARTT, or some other flexible mechanism, to resolve the low salary and short workday problems; providing for much greater participation by the private sector to guide NCARTT's research programs; building a constituency to lobby for governmental policy reforms and budgetary support; and, the early elaboration of an agricultural research and technology transfer strategy to set the context and direction for NCARTT programs.\nThe consumption and equipping of the four regional agricultural services centers and the National Center building at Baq'a were and still are, far behind schedule. The delays in construction and the lack of proper sequencing of events (construction, staff training, and ordering and arrival of the equipment), have most definitely hampered NCARTT's ability to conduct research, transfer technology, and provide needed services to the agricultural sector.\nThe Agricultural Research Strategy and Medium Term Plan represent an important first step in defining research needs and priorities.\nThe Training Program has been quite ambitious and successful involving a significant number of women.",
      "Key Recommendations": "The NCARTT Council should continue to push for legal full-autonomy. It should undertake a continuing effort to identify and recruit the highest quality employees, reduce its professional and support staff, seek funding for joint research activities with local organizations. \nThe NCARTT Council and management should work with the Ministry of Agriculture, Faculties of Agriculture and the private sector and establish a process for formal involvement of farmers, strengthen its capacity to carry out an expanded program of technology transfer to disseminate technology to many different technology transfer agents and it should form a committee b make a careful analysis of the numbers and kinds of laboratories that are essential to its research and technology transfer activities, both at the national headquarters.",

      "Key Findings": "Entrepreneurial growth has been indirectly supported by the increased occupational status of returnees, although only a few have started their own business.  \nTraining has resulted in a marked shift in the employment  and income of long-term returnees, and a somewhat less of a shift in employment and income for short-term\nreturnees.\nTraining has resulted in a significant transition from low to high job status for returnees.\nIncreased job status and income has increased the responsibilities and opportunities of returnees in their various occupational  roles.",
      "Key Recommendations": "If the goal of training is to create entrepreneurial growth through training programs, it is suggested that training be directed at promoting leadership among owners of micro enterprise and in providing trainees with curricular focused on the development of operation of  micro enterprises. \nSelection for future training activities should continue to focus on poor and disenfranchised groups particularly indigenous people, women and rural inhabitants   ",

      "Key Findings": "The Kibale Forest Project has had an ambitious agenda to help develop Ugandan capacity to manage the Kibale Forest (now Kibale National Park) and to nurture the continued development of the Makerere University Biological Field Station (MUBFS). Supported with substantial USAlD/Kampala funding, the project has been well-justified by the valuable history of research at MUBFS and by the considerable potential for the station to develop into the premier African center for research and training in forest biodiversity conservation and management; by the substantial but largely unrealized potential for primate and forest-based ecotourism in Kibale that could benefit both park management and local communities; and by the clear need for technical assistance to help local communities derive measurable benefits from the intact forest. However, the project's implementation has been thwarted by numerous constraints: among them, very poorly defined and increasingly difficult relationships between cooperating institutions and project personnel, limited financial administration provided by Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), slow disbursement of USAID funds to the project, early departures of personnel from key project positions with very slow replacement, turnover in Ugandan institutional authority over the forest, and limited [mancial and institutional investment in the field station by Makerere University.",
      "Key Recommendations": "USAIDlKampala should continue to support the development of Kibale National Park and the Makerere University Biological Field Station.\nUSAID should support (a) training, infrastructure development, research and community environmental education at MUBFS, and (b) capacity-building for Uganda National Parks to sustainably manage Kibale National Park and develop support for the park in buffer-zone communities. These should be treated as discrete activities and probably funded through two separate institutions.\nDuring the no greater than 12 month bridging period, USAID funding for MUBFS should focus on basic station infrastructure improvement, continuity of field courses and improved coordination of research and training objectives with KNP.\nMakerere University (MU) should strengthen its financial, technical and administrative support for MUBFS.\nBeyond the bridge, Makerere University should form a consortium with one or more qualified universities and possibly conservation NGO's to operate MUBFS for the next several years.\nThe consortium should appoint one person as MUBFS director, with a strong technical background, significant international experience, and substantial management and leadership skills.\nGreater efforts should be made to increase participation of Ugandan and other African students and scientists in MUBFS research and training.",

      "Key Findings": "The contract originally called for services by Metrica for the\nperiod September 30, 1989 to September 29 1993. A series of \nshort-term extensions for the purpose of having Metrica's resources\navailable to allow the project office to assist USAID\nreorganization efforts -specifically, the development of\nissues and policy on external advice on research through the provision of consultants and experts -carried the contract through to December 15, 1994. There was a relatively low level of utility of the contract in the period April 1993-May 1994, again because of the outstanding issues to be resolved on research and the\nuse of external advice in research review, and, as a consequence, there were unexpended funds in the contract at the contract expired (the amount is not determined at the time of this report.",
      "Key Recommendations": "\"One of the ad hoc external advisory panels that Metrica\narranged dealt with the issue of using external technical advice on research policy and priorities. The panel believed it was not only\nnecessary but beneficial for USAID to employ some mechanism on a\nregular basis to do this. The Agency Research Council's review of\nthe agriculture and food security research portfolio showed that\nexternal expertise was necessary (and was provided through\nMetrica). Yet the Council has no vehicle of its own to do this.\nIt is getting external advice on other development sectors on an ad\nhoc basis, but it is bound to run into OYB-type problems without\nsome project/contract type of mechanism to assist.\"",

Trainees wanted more information provided to them during the Predqartrrre Oriertarion program about Follow-on activities.\n3. APSP Trainees wanted more specific information about US academic life, in general, and their course of study in particular.\n4. Overall, US training experiences met or exceeded Trainees' expectations.\n5. Some students who attended the Spanish\nlanguage program at the University of New Mexico expressed dissatisfaction with aspects of the program. \n6. Many students were frustrated by not being able to complete a graduate degree. \n7. Trainees actively participated in the Experience America program. Trainees learn about US culture and achieved a new perspective on their own culture as well.\n8. The trainees benefited from the Follow-on program which was organized and fully implemented by the time they retired from training. \n9. Trainees returned to Ecuador, are in their fields of study, and are applying their training in their careers.  \n\nFindings of EDSP Evaluation:\n\n1. EDSP has surpassed its 40 percent target for women participants. Over half the Trainees (53%) are women. The majority of the Trainees\n( 82% ) were classified as disadvantaged according to the USAID/Ecuador definition of disadvantaged.\n2. Overall, the EDSP short-term training programs are well-organized and successfully implemented to achieve development impact upon the Trainees' return. \n3. The follow-on program provides seminars and workshops for all groups of EDSP participants to reinforce the US training. \n4. Trainees are employed in their field of expertise and they are applying their skills to their jobs. \n5. Trainees are active in community affairs and maintain a relationship with the United States.

      "Document Title": "Midterm Evaluation of the Natural Resources Based Agricultural Research Project (NRBAR)",
      "Key Findings": "1. The Natural Resources Based Agricultural Research Project (NRBAR) is restrictive in comparison to the Senegalese Institute for Agricultural Research (ISRA) scope of action in the area of agricultural research. Indeed, since ISRA research activities are conducted throughout the national territory and cover all the products and agricultural production systems, there is a problem of compatibility with the limits fixed at the outset by NRBAR project whose interventions were restricted to 4 crops and to areas where rainfall exceeds 400 mm. Furthermore, the geographical location of some members of the technical assistance team who are separated from their counterparts, and the existence of distinct NRBAR/CID offices, makes NRBAR look more like a separate entity. There is also insufficient coordination for the achievement of NRBAR activities and insufficient acceptance of responsibilities by certain counterparts. \n2. Implementation of the research planning and organization component seems to have had the greatest impact on both ISRA's institutional and scientific consolidation. By improving the quality of research and planning organization of the Institute, the actions taken have undoubtedly contributed to the institutionalization of practices which definitely improve the scientific and technical performance of its programs.\n3. The NRBAR project has made a significant contribution to the design of ISRA's Natural Resources Management program. The contribution has to a large extent enabled: the establishment of the program planning committee, the design of a Geographical Information System, the design of a natural resources-based research strategy.\n4. Despite the faltering noted at the beginning, the research and development program contributed to the improvement of ISRA's institutional capability with the tools and mechanisms it put at its disposal. They are:\n- Design, management, and monitoring instruments for the grant research actions;\n- Institution of regular progress report mechanisms\n- Institution of regular visits to the test sites by partner groups and ad hoc committees\n- Participatory evaluation of each campaign test results to assess all the lessons learned in order to improve on decisions\n5. As regards ISRA's financial management system, the Ernst and Young Firm has made enough progress despite the lack of monitoring and of supervision by ISRA. The shortcomings are: incomplete inventory of ISRA's needs in the areas of processing and monitoring, insufficient involvement of ISRA users in the system design, inadequacy of the proposed strategy for ISRA's actual needs in matters of financial management.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. - Appoint a single counterpart for each technical assistant.\n- Integrate technical assistance as a whole into ISRA structure by having the technical assistants and their counterparts \"work in the same location in order to get used to working together.\n- Enhance consultation and exchange of information among the technical assistants and their counterparts and the various components of the NRBAR project through regular consultation meetings.\n- Institute within each Binomial (technical assistance team member/ISRA counterpart), the establishment of mandatory work plans and of regular activities programs with a clear division of tasks.\n2. ISRA, in conjunction with the NRBAR technical\nassistance team, and while making the necessary arrangements to\nthis end, takes advantage of the scientific management and\ninstitutional tools like the Geographical Information System, the\nMonitoring Evaluation Plan and the Natural Resource-Based\nResearch Strategic Plan developed with the Project assistance.\n3. - Consolidate project experience in the implementation of several research activities regarding the technologies to be tested on-farm in order to be validated and/or adopted in relation to the activities with the different actors in a workshop which would appraise the achievements and the steps to be taken to carry out more effective actions and to give a more appropriate direction to the next programs.\n- Complete the grant activity submission protocols so that in the next programs the nature and the type of the planned activities (validation/ adoption or others) are specified, the technology to be developed determined and characterized, and the time frame for the program implementation adjusted to its type and nature.\n- Scale down and redefine the collaborative research activities so as to have the population as a whole solely involved in the adoption activities. The validation of technologies should be placed under the exclusive responsibility of the researcher who may set them up in carefully selected plots.\n- There is a very limited number of technologies currently implemented in the program. At this pace/ the project is very unlikely to completely achieve its objective.",

      "Key Findings": "1) Recruitment and Selection Procedures: In recruitment, the program had not reached the target of 40 percent participation by women, though there was no systematic pattern of discrimination against women in the selection process. The inequities in geographic distribution of CAPSIHOPS-I favoring central and eastern departments were overcome under HOPS-II. \n2) Pre-departure Orientation and Training: The HOPS-II pre-departure orientation and training model is the most complete program in the regional CLASP program. For some short-term programs, the training has become a complete training program itself, making the U.S. training redundant. English language instruction was identified as the most problematic element for both short and long-term trainees. \n3) U.S. Training: Peace Scholars who receive Bachelors or Masters Degrees are very satisfied with the training received, while those receiving an Associate of Arts degree encountered difficulty in finding employment and in transferring their credits to Honduran universities. HOPS-I1 scholars are more committed than CAPS I scholars to applying their training to the development problems of Honduras. \n4) Impact in the Workplace and Community: Overall, CAPSIHOPS trainees enjoy high levels of employment, and are also very involved in community activities. \n5) Follow-on activities: Activities supported through follow-on have reached substantial numbers of people. Follow-on has monitored the utilization of training, maintained appropriate data on returned trainees, reduced difficulties of trainee re-entry, and fostered the creation of various regional and occupational associations. 6) Costs: The relative costs for CAPS in the U.S. were in the low r \n",
      "Key Recommendations": "1) There is a need for a more active recruitment of women, adopting a 50 percent participation rate for women, as well as increased lead time during the recruitment process. Concerning the selection process, HOPS-I1 was commended for introducing the week-long selection seminar. The seminar should be maintained and should, as a model, be shared with other CLASP Missions. \n2) Pre-departure training should be shortened and oriented toward the objective of supporting U.S. training, with improved communication with U.S. training institutions. For long-term trainees, more emphasis should be placed on English proficiency to pass the TOEFL, with more information about the U.S. academic system. Competing program components during pre-departure training should be reduced. \n3) Pre-departure orientation should include a stronger experiential cross-cultural orientation for all trainees, and long-term trainees should receive clearer guidelines about the types of non-academic activities available at U.S. universities. \n 4) The training design process should include a wider range of interested parties to ensure that the training plan ' developed for the training provider is directly related to the candidates' needs. In addition, group training plans should project expected results with respect to trainee participation in volunteer activities\n5) Support should be maintained for the regional associations, for leadership seminars, and for linkages between short and long-term trainees. The Mission should continue to provide support for the CAPSIHOPS follow-on activities which have ensured substantive impact as a result of training. \n6) In view of budget cutbacks, future training should be co-funded with Mission technical offices.\n",

      "Key Findings": "The new discipline - development ethics- emerges from two sources, which are now converging: from engagement in development activities to the formulation of ethical theory, and from a critique of mainstream ethical theory to the crafting of normative strategies to guide development practice. Development ethics has a dual mission: to render the economy more human and to keep hope alive in the face of the seeming impossibility of achieving human development for all.",

Participants were from the private and public sectors, although the Project emphasized the private sector.\nThe Project offered training opportunities on both a long and short-term basis and introduced the trainees to the social, political, and cultural values in the United States.\n\nThis training Project, in addition to the new knowledge and skills, gave the trainees a new vision of themselves, with increased confidence and a greater sense of responsibility, a new view of the world, being more open minded and aware of the many options available. Knowledge of the English language enabled the trainees to get better jobs, obtain promotions, and increased incomes\n\nTo allow the participation by national, provincial, and local leaders, the geographic scope of the program was broad. Special attention was given to achieve a high level of participation of the economically disadvantaged, women, and members of the minority population groups, which had not received sufficient support in the past.\n\n",

      "Key Findings": "Unfortunately, the project is beginning to deteriorate in terms of the amount of research being conducted and with respect to the ratio of research to management costs. This is due to the reduction of overall funding levels wherein minimum staffing levels are required for maintenance of the project leaving research to be 'reduced.\n\nICRAF presently records the USAID network grant as multilateral funding and programs its use without the benefit of a network steering committee and, on occasion, without significant input from national program leaders.\nThe project success in technology development and dissemination is best attested to by its significant impacts among farmers (see Section TI) and through its improved and more rapid use of limited resources in a very cost effective manner. This is not to say things are perfect.\n\nWith the exceptions of the modifications recommended for the ICRAF/AFRENA network, the management structure and relationships among a relatively complex web (network) of actors is basically satisfactory. The selection of work to be done is relevant and having considerable impacts. It involves the appropriate people and institutions.\n\nThe financial management procedures and performances are generally adequate. The exceptions cited in Section IV are for specific instances not of a fundamental nature. The project has appropriately moved financial management decisions increasingly closer to the operational entities involved with the use of the funds.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "Recommendation: That the research budgets be increased for the networks. If this is not\npossible and oiUy a fixed level of financing is available, then the most productive networks\nshould be supported rather than witness a withering of all four networks.",

      "Key Findings": "Since its creation in June 1994, the Association for the Strengthening of Agricultural Research in East and Central Africa (ASARECA) has undertaken a large number of activities in pursuit of broad objectives. The major important accomplishments include (a) the delivery of reports by five working groups, (b) the incorporation of four existing research networks into ASARECA's ongoing operations, and (c) the review and evaluation of other research efforts.\n\nASARECA's own deliberative processes have now produced a substantial volume of information, analysis, and programmatic recommendations concerning research priorities and associated cross-cutting needs. These deliberations will continue and even gather momentum, especially as new Networks are formed and the existing regional Networks and Task Forces adjust to and refine the findings of the Priorities Working Group. For the next two years or so, the need to sift through programmatic options and develop sound and responsive programs will demand a great deal of time, attention, and resources on the part of ASARECA and its stakeholders.\n\nA great deal of agriculture research capacity exists in the university systems of the ASARECA countries. There are more Ph.D. holders in the agriculture faculties than in the ASARECA NARIs. A dialogue with the Deans of Agriculture ofASARECA member countries has begun in connection with the review of the report of the Human Resources Development Working Group.\n\nThe main task for ASARECA over the next three years is the development of its regional program. This will mainly evolve from the foundation of projects, project ideas, and programmatic recommendations that have been generated by ASARECA deliberative processes and dialogues with stakeholders.",

This has led to current breeding objectives to produce an improved local photosensitive sorghum with tan plant color specifically for use in value added processing. A product of this research is a new sorghum product called SORI which was developed in Mali. The process is similar to rice parboiling. Partially cooked, steeped sorghum was dried and decorticated to produce endosperm pieces that can be cooked like rice. \n\nSoil Management CRSP programs have identified readily available plant species that are well suited to low-input sustainable land-management systems.\nPastures based on acid-tolerant legumes and compatible grasses increase per unit.  cattle-production area in the humid tropics, thus raising income and food quality while reducing the need to destroy more rain forests.\n",

      "Document Title": "Improving Educational Quality Project: Final Report",
      "Key Findings": "1.  With rare exceptions, pupil performance in intensive intervention schools was significantly better than pupil performance in non-intensive intervention schools.\n2. Demonstrating Potential: The IEQ Project has discovered the untapped potential of educators within the system. Our experience suggests that educational improvement is sparked when people become engaged in the process of reform. IEQ has debunked some myths about teacher disinterest, community turnover of education to teachers, etc., and it has shown that the infrastructure of a system may be strengthened to bring about indigenous reform.\n3. Building Capacity: Both institutional and individual capacity is strengthened through IEQ. The heart of IEQ lies in each partner country, as institutions \"host\" IEQ teams. The local teams carry the bulk of the workload and have added new skills to their professional repertoire, such as the use of qualitative research methods.\n4. Opening Doors:  All participants are part of the learning curve. The project staff have seen that the key to improvement rests with recognizing one's relationship to other pieces of the system. When information is both shared and made public, it brings new people into the dialogue (parents, teachers, regional educators) and suggests new roles for some of them, e.g., circuit supervisors and head teachers become instructional resources, not \"inspectors.\n5. . Creating Knowledge: IEQ creates new knowledge as information flows within and across the system. The key is how the information is presented, shared, and used. It must be \"user friendly\" and audience-specific.\n6. Developing Research Tools: IEQ host-country research teams have used qualitative and quantitative methods to capture what is happening in the classroom. They have developed a variety of techniques for assessment: achievement measures in numeracy and literacy; interview protocols for parents, pupils, local and regional supervisors, and community members; classroom observation forms which describe interactions among pupils and between teachers and pupils; instructional materials; and information on the learning environment.",
      "Key Recommendations": "-Curriculum-Based Assessment (CBA) instruments are valuable for garnering support for improvement if they lead to data that have meaning to those who will use them.\n\n-Developing good instruments takes time and revision: Often it may take several steps to get to the final instrument. For example, CBA test questions were pilot tested and revised prior to the first administration.\n-Classroom research can guide and improve innovations.\n-Don't choose institutional partners on the promises of public officials. As the IEQ experience in Guatemala shows, public officials are subject to the decisions of their superiors or to unforeseen changes resulting from changes such as elections or coups d'etat.\n-Use more than achievement tests in assessing educational quality\n-Reading skill levels of the target population of children should be measured prior to the development of instructional materials and the range of ability factored into material development. \n-Participation in learning contexts that promote the development of pro-social or democratic behaviors in the classroom may be important in determining if children stay in school. \n\n-Poor nutritional status is likely to be a limiting factor to educational attainment in rural areas of developing countries.\n\n\n",

      "Key Findings": "The development of research capacity of the institutes in the NARS of Sri Lanka has been uneven and fragmented. The absence of a national research policy and of a long-term vision for future has been a major factor affecting the overall performance. The expectation that the CARP would assume leadership of and credibility among the institutions of the NARS without dynamic and respected leaders and an inbuilt dependency of the institutions on the CARP and without control of the funds was misplaced. CARP would require fundamental changes to overcome inherent institutional and functional weaknesses in order to evolve into an institution of utility and importance. CARP should also have some control over budget allocation within the NARS. \nThe NARP, despite the range of details on the research system lacks a vision for the future development of the whole research system. Such a vision should, inter alia, outline the changing demands for technology, the expected roles of the public and private sectors, and the role of the universities. The vision should also analyse future scenarios for funding research and identify needed changes in the public research sector to promote greater efficiency. The value of CADMAR and INFORM have been clearly demonstrated, but these management tools were not utilized by all institutes. \n The contract research program has been partially successful. However, it provides an essential means for sponsoring inter-institutional research, mobilizing the greatly under-utilized research resources of the universities. \n",
      "Key Recommendations": "(a) A vision statement of the future evolution of the research system should be a precondition for Bank support to a new lending program for agricultural research; \n(b) Greater consideration should be given at appraisal to aspects of institutional consolidation especially when the NARS is fragmented and when salaries are low and operational costs are scarce; \n(c) The expectation that the CARP would assume leadership of and credibility among the institutions of the NARS without dynamic and respected leaders and an inbuilt dependency of the institutions on the CARP and without control of the funds was misplaced; \n(d) The emphasis of the project on human resources development training, strategic provision of equipment, and provision of good housing were important factors in achieving a highly competent and motivated scientific staff, which is particularly important in attracting and retaining staff at more remote research institutes; \n(e) Considerable savings could be made if the training program is administered by an efficient project management unit instead of external consultants and if the split-training program is fostered; and\n(f) Contract research administered by a central body, when appropriately managed, provides an essential means for sponsoring inter-institutional research, mobilizing the greatly under-utilized research resources of the universities, promoting joint research with the private sector, and encouraging strategic and upstream research in key areas.",

In the working group in which I presented our paper, participants raised issues about the unique losses women may experience in this transition, including rights to land (when, for example, new “private” holdings are issued\nin the name of the head of the household only), kindergarten and day care for children,\nand other social supports such as medical care that were provided through subsidies on the former collective and state farms in Central Asia and Eastern Europe.\nAnother issue raised at this working group, and in the plenary sessions, is whether increasing women’s formal ownership rights to land is likely to make real changes in intra-household distribution of income and expenditures, and relative labor contributions by family members. Conference participants broadly acknowledged the\nneed for further research on issues regarding farm reorganization, land tenure and women’s rights.\n(2) Whether emphasis on micro-credit (and other “micro”) programs by international donors are effective tools for serving the needs of rural women. Some argued that these programs are effective, not just toward increasing access of rural women to much-needed capital, but also toward facilitating grass-roots organization among women in rural communities to address broader social problems.\n(3) Whether the Panchayat Law in India could be replicated in other settings in the developing world increase participation of rural women at various levels of government.\n\n",
