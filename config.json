We hope that by compiling this evidence in one place with a number of filter and search features, we will help facilitate the use of evidence.",
            "The “gap” in the title is referring to understanding where there is good evidence in the matrix and where there are holes in our knowledge base and understanding. As users interact with the evidence gap map and the filters, they will be able to visually see where there is knowledge and where additional investments in research and evaluation might be warranted to further build the evidence base. The map was designed for a primary audience of USAID technical staff and program designers."
